          Everything you see is created by Jan Rehmeyer, 

          <h2>Your data TODO</h2>
          Your data will only be used to contact you in the following cases:
          <br><br>
              To confirm your email-address (only after this happened, the password reset function will be possible)
              <br><br>
              To reset your password.
          
          When you delete your account, all data related to the account will be deleted immediately from the database. Some data may remain on the server for up to 30 days for backup purposes. These backups are only accessed in an emergency and you can request an immediate deletion of your data even in backups by sending an email to the address provided below. Otherwise your data will be automatically deleted completely after 30 days.
          
          Your data is only used to offer you the service of creating and viewing your own notes. It will not be read, modified or used in any other way by someone else. The only exception is if you explicitly make certain pages public. Then they can be viewed by anyone who has the link. This feature is disabled by default.

          This service will store a single cookie on your system when you are logged in to verify that you are logged in.
          Local Storage and Indexed DB
          This service will cache data that is displayed to enable you to use this site even when offline. All that data is deleted when you log out.
