    <h1>Ascension</h1>
    
    Pursuing an Ambition usually leads to conflict and those that emerge from that conflict as victorious will have become stronger and more powerful in the pursuit of their Ambition for it.
    Almost everyone will sooner or later find their match and inevitably lose one or more of these conflicts.
    Only a few handful during each generation will come far enough during their arcs, that they are remembered for it, often as legendary heroes or villains, mythical creatures or tales of caution.
    An of these few, only a tiny subset managed to go even one step further, reaching their Ambition and ascending to a new sphere of existence.

    <br><br>

    By truly and fully reaching and fullfilling an Ambition, one ascends, dissolving their mortal form and becoming one with their Ambition, creating an abstract concept of ones self and more or less becoming a god.
    This Ascension entails a heavy toll on the fabric of reality, often times creating rifts and tears in the veil, and sometimes even creates whole new spaces, like Limbo or the TODO: Feywild.

    <br><br>

    Ascension has so far only been achieved by a few handfuls of individuals, most of them happening almost simultaneously during ancient times in the Age of Ascension, where early civilisations, lead by powerful "Gods" waged wars and lead to the Ascension, damning millions to die and permanently changing Akudia.

    <h2>Gods</h2>

    To fully achieve ones Ambition is only part of ascending, the other, and usually more important, is to convince others of ones Ambition, making them believe and follow, gaining more power through them.
    During the Age of Ascension this was pushed to its limits, as multiple extremely powerful entities began amassing followers or even creating their own, nudging them ever closer to reaching godhood.

    Those that ascend can be considered gods, as they become one with their Ambition, granting them powers unlike any others, but also damning them to a pssive role in the gradn scheme of things.
    Their direct influence on the world however diminishes greatly, as they are fully dependent on their followers that pick up their Ambition.
    Many of those that ascended, were not too happy to learn of that, but once they realized, it was too late, as their ascension could not be stopped anymore.
    These individuals are considered the defiant gods, often times spiteful and selfish.
    Others welcomed their ascension, becoming one with what they embodied their whole life.
