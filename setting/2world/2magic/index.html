    <h1>The Arcane</h1>

    To wield magic in this world means to be a weaver, a seamstress or a tailor.
    It means to control and modify the very fabric of reality that underlies the world.
    <br><br>
    Controlling this power is no easy task as toying with the fabric means playing with the protective barrier between the reality and null.
    Many that tried were consumed by the temptation of unlimited power and the ability to do everything one could think of.
    Since the Ascension the fabric of reality has been weak and damaged, Rogamon and other powerful individuals did their part aswell, permanently ripping the fabric.
    Today arcanes have to be cautious as to not overextend their powers and accidentally tear open a new rift into Null.

    <h2>Elements of Reality</h2>

    The world is made up of all manner of things, earth, air and light, to name but a few.
    There are some unspoken and primal rules that make up reality, think of them as the basic elements of existence, building blocks that are the origin of everything.
    <br><br>
    These elements are as follows:
    <br>
    <ul>
      <li>Fire</li>
      <li>Water</li>
      <li>Earth</li>
      <li>Air</li>
      <li>Essence</li>
      <li>Light</li>
      <li>Mind</li>
      <li>Time</li>
      <li>Space</li>
      <li>Life</li>
    </ul>

    Weaving spells means manipulating and subduing these elements and give them new purpose or use them as tools and weapons.

    <h2>Arcane Threads</h2>

    To weave an arcane spell, one must gather threads, threads that must be taken, borrowed or stolen from the fabric of reality, more precise, one or more of the elements.
    Once drawn, an Arcane can channel them through their body and shape them, giving them a new form, thus creating a spell.
    <br><br>
    Every thread that is taken from the fabric, creates a weak spot in the protective layer and can, if not properly disposed of, open up rifts to Null.
    These threads are also volatile, the more of them an Arcane pulls into themselves, the more dangerous and prone to accidents their magic becomes.
    <br>
    After creating a magical effect, the threads usually will flow back into the fabric and close any wounds in reality.
    <br><br>
    Every being on Akudia is connected to these threads, sometimes more and sometimes less, to make use of them however, one must be connected to the fabric on a deeper level.
    Some manage this by study, most however are born with an affinity for one or more of the elements.

    <h2>Static Magic</h2>

    Sometimes the arcane threads used in the creation of a magical effect will not properly flow back into the fabric of reality.
    Instead they will sequester and stay in place.
    This phenomenon is called static magic and has been used in a variety of ways.
    <br><br>
    Magical effects can be made accessible to those that feel a connection to the arcane threads, but do not possess the powers to wield the elements directly.
    Other times, these loose threads manifest themselves in items, places or rituals and become tangible objects in the world.

    <h2>Null</h2>

    If you were to take a look behind the fabric, maybe through an open rift or a portal to another world, chances are, you will see Null.
    Null is the all-encompassing void and chaos that lies behind the fabric of reality and its mirror dimensions.
    <br>
    It is best described as a maelstrom of pure magic and home to some of the most bizarre and most dangerous things in existence.
    Most of the time, Null manifests itself as bright pink and jagged crystals, consuming arcane magic and transforming the elements in unpredictable ways, which often ends in disaster.
    <br><br>
    It is Null that is the sole limiter of an Arcanes power in practice, as no matter how powerful you might be and how good your control over the elements might seem, sooner or later you will make a mistake, allowing Null to consume you and everything around you.
