    <h1>The Inhabitants of Akudia</h1>

    Akudia is home to a multitude of intelligent beings, called sentients. They are most affected by Ambitions and are responsible for most of the stories told.
    Other creatures were either created by the Ascension of the gods, born from null, or even made by the hands of the elves.
    The sentients make up a large chunk of intelligent creatures in the world of Akudia and are split into different forms, races or ancestries.
    The most important ones are listed here, though there are many more different kinds, these are the most numerous and influental during Akudias history.

    <h3>Elves</h3>

    The elves can only be described as a nearly perfect creation.
    They are among the oldest and most powerful of the sentients, posessing a vast intellect, the ability to be reborn and an affinity for biological and genetic craftsmanship, which they used to attain control of Kontralos for centuries.
    <br>
    As long as they bind their souls to an anchor, they will be able to be reborn after death, which is greatly needed, as the number of elven souls that exist in the world, is limited to a certain number that can not change.
    Though they will be a new person after rebirth, the soul will stay the same and memories, knowledge and past experiences will be given to the new body.
    
    <br><br>

    After the humans arrived on Kontralos, the elves began falling ill and their souls did not return after death, marking an extinction that was only comparable to the one brought on by the Ascension.
    Bloody wars were fought, as the humans were thought to be responsible, but in the end, the elves were lost and went extinct.
    <br>
    Still, today there are many remnants of them that can be found all over the world.
    The most obvious are the half elves, born from relationships of humans and elves, which passed their ancestors genes down to them, granting them some of their powers.

    <h3>Humans</h3>

    Humans are often called the locusts of Akudia, based on their sheer numbers and their unending hunger and drive to expand, conquer and strip clean all of the available space, not only on Kontralos, but on all of Akudia.
    They were left behind during the flight from Taurora, almost eradicating their existence as a whole, but some of them persevered and after long and painful centuries, they managed to arrive on Kontralos as well.
    <br>
    There they quickly expanded and wrestled control over the continent from its inhabitants, they drove the Kornas Ancestors almost to extinction and are thought of as the reason the elves died and never returned.
    After only a few centuries, the last bastion of hope lied completely in human hands and still does to this day.
    <br><br>
    
    Humans are however not all bad, they are usually quick to forget past conflicts and in the gradn scheme of things are welcoming of the other sentients (with a few exceptions), integrating them into their societies and cultures.
    Their endless drive and especially strong Ambitions make them excellent survivalists and it is through them, that many expeditions into the dead lands of Taurora have been started recently.

    <h3>Durag</h3>

    The Durag are a unique people, born from stone and living mostly underground and around mountains, they are a hardy folk and keep to themselves.
    Once they were great allies of the elves, but after the humans made them go extinct, the Durag mostly withdrew from the surface of the world.
    Some of them can still be found in cities or towns and there are even some strongholds of Durag culture, but for the most part they became quite rare.

    <br><br>

    Durag embody stone and mineral, not only in culture, but also physical appearance and life cycle.
    They are born as fossilized egg-like babies and slowly break free from their shells, becoming living and breathing creatures.
    During their lives they consume rocks, minerals and ores and take on appearance based on their surroundings.
    The older a Durag becomes, the more they resemble stone, making it harder and harder to move, until they become one with the stone around them one day, marking the end of their life.

    <br><br>

    Durag society is rigid and strict, respect and stoicism are very important

    <h3>Orvosa</h3>

    The Orvosa never had an easy life and a complicated history.
    They are one of the youngest kind of sentients as they were not created by the fabric of reality, but instead at the hands of a deviant god, Orvos, who made them in his image and wanted to use them to gain an edge during the ascension wars.
    <br>
    Almost demonic in nature, they inflict a deep and subconsious fear and mistrust in everyone around them, making it hard for them to not be ostracized or even hunted down.

    <br><br>

    They were the last of the sentients to escape Taurora and managed to reach Kontralos as well.
    Here they mostly keep to their own communities and live on the edges of society and although some of them even manage to make a name for themselves, they still are feared and mistrusted by the humans especially.

    <h2>The Elve's Creations</h2>

    After the flight to Kontralos, the elves, numerous and determined to rule their newfound home, began creating living beings on their own, combining their vast arcane knowledge with their biological affinity.
    Many of these creations were used as tools to control their rivals or as weapons of war which proved especially effective against the human expansions on Kontralos during the elven wars of extinction, though in the end it was in vain.
