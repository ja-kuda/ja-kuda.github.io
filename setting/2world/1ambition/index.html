    <h1>Ambition</h1>

    A single concept called Ambition rules over and creates all life on Akudia and maybe even all the other spaces in the void.
    No one knows where it comes from, what its purpose is, and why it manifests itself in realities, but it can be felt by everything and everyone and shapes life with invisible hands.

    <br><br>

    Ambitions are not only a mere concept, but possess tangible power and considerable influence over all living beings on Akudia.
    They drive and push creatures, especially those of a sentient nature to strife for greatness and power, potentially culminating in their ascension.
    This drive and the subsequent actions of individuals are known as their arc, what exactly that is depends on each creatures personal Ambition and abilities.

    <br><br>

    Ambition is ubiquitous and permeates all layers of reality, it is often considered inevitable and most treat it as little more than an aspect of life.
    Some others however make use of their ambitions and accomplish great (or less great) deeds in the world.
    
    <br><br>

    When Ambitions clash, conflict arises, usually on a personal level, but if not contained or ended, can quickly envelop groups, factions or even kingdoms and nations.
    The world might never get rid of conflict, as it is born just as quick, as it can be resolved.
