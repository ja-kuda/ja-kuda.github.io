    <h1>Ambition</h1>

    No one knows where it comes from, what its purpose is, and why it manifests itself in this reality, but one thing is for sure:

    <br><br>

    Ambitions are not only a mere concept, but possess tangible power and considerable influence over all living beings on Akudia.

    <br><br>

    They drive and push creatures, especially those of a sentient nature to strife for greatness and power, potentially culminating in their ascension.
    Ambition is ubiquitous and permeates all layers of reality, it is often considered inevitable and most treat it as little more than an aspect of life.

    <br><br>

    Some others however make use of their ambitions and accomplish great (or less great) deeds in the world.
    
    <br><br>

    When Ambitions clash, conflict arises, usually on a personal level, but if not contained or ended, can quickly envelop groups, factions or even kingdoms and nations.
    The world might never get rid of conflict, as it is born just as quick, as it can be resolved.
