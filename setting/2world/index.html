    <h1>Akudia</h1>

    Although existence itself is merely a fragment of the endless chaos of the void, there are pockets of order and stability, like the reality that inhabits the world of Akudia.
    And although this reality is just barely protected from the chaos of the null dimension, it still exists and thrives.

    <br><br>

    It may be a coincidence, that the world of Akudia exists, just a lucky toss of a stone in the vast emptyness of the void that surrounds all, but Akudia exists because of something called the veil, the weave, or sometimes the fabric of reality.
    Like a protective coating, it surrounds reality as we know it and exists since time immemorial.
    This fabric has been subject to many changes and manipulation during its existence and many have tried to look past it to see for themselves, what the rest of the primal chaos has to offer.
    Sometimes this opened up similar spaces to that of Akudia, but more often than not, it simply created rifts in the veil, allowing chaos and null to invade Akudia.

    <br><br>

    The world of Akudia is a place where life can exist, civilisations can be born and destroyed, creatures of all manner can flourish and wreak havoc upon the world and most importantly of all, Akudia is a place that creates stories.
    Stories of tragedy, heroism, stories of loss and love, stories of darkness and also hope.
    All of these stories are driven by Ambitions, pushing creatures and people to follow their own paths, sometimes even as far as changing or controlling the fabric of reality itself by using arcane magic.

    <br><br>

    <h2>What to expect</h2>
    The world of Akudia can best be described as a typical fantasy world with a twist.
    <br>
    Many classic aspects like magic, monsters, intrigue and fundamentally medieval time period that seems to be stuck in time are present, however many details might not be what you expected.
    There are no typical gods, technology creeps its way into everyday life, reality is constantly under threat from the void all around it and weaving magic endangers the natural order of things are just some examples of the things to expect in this world.
    <br><br>
    The world of Akudia is built around the core concepts of Ambition and vice versa.
    This allows to create stories in a world that fits the rules with rules that fit the world you play in.
    <br><br>
    If you are a fan of medieval fantasy stories, you will feel right at home in Akudia.
