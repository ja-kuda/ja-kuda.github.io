    <h1>Akudia</h1>

    Although existence itself is merely a fragment of the endless chaos of the void, there are pockets of order and stability, like the reality that inhabits the world of Akudia.
    An although this reality is just barely protected from the chaos of the null dimension, it still exists.

    <br>

    Cynical minds might call it a mere coincidence, a lucky toss of a stone in an endless ocean of primal chaos, others call it the veil, the weave or even the fabric of reality.
    Whatever it may be, the fact is, that this fabric creates a barrier from the outside and makes up the reality as we know it.
