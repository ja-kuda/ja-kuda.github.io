    <h1>The demise of the Elves</h1>

    <h2>Humans arrive on Kontralos</h2>

    Thousands of years ago, decades or maybe even centuries, after they were left behind on the dying continent Taurora, some humans arrived on Kontralos.
    And in the lush arms of the continent, they multiplied fast.
    <br>
    In the beginning the other cultures and races welcomed the new arrivals with open arms.
    Later on they began giving the humans settlers the nickname of Locusts of Kontralos, as they swept across the continent, integrating and overpowering the other cultures and even driving one of them, the Korna, to the edges of their realms.
    <br><br>
    Though the elves still were the undisputed rulers of the lands through their use of biological weaponry and magic, they would soon learn what it meant to die.

    <h2>The pale sickness</h2>

    It began quickly after the humans arrived, the elves became sick.
    First it was the children, newborn bodies, imbued with the souls of their ancestors that became sickly pale and weak.
    <br>
    Then it spread to others, infecting seemingly without contact.
    The elves, normally immune to sickness and disease, had no way of stopping it, even their knowledge of life led to no answers.
    But one thing was for sure, the humans must have brought this upon them to gain full control over the continent.
    <br><br>
    And so, while their children died, their souls not returning from Limbo and their numbers dwindling, the remaining elves declared war on the invaders.
