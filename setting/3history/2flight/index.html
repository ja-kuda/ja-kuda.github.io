    <h1>The age of Flight</h1>

    During the destruction brought onto the world by the Ascension and the wars preceding it, countless lives were lost and entire civilisations were destroyed.
    A glimmer of Hope however shone on the horizon, the possibility of a new beginning.
    To reach it however, the remaining Elves, Humans, Durag and all of the other creatures, had to survive the now treacherous and deadly Taurora and flee from it, to another place.

    <h2>A continent dying</h2>

    With each passing day, live on Taurora became more and more impossible.
    Arcane storms ravaged the landmass, leaving rifts and tears in their wake, monsters were born and began roaming the vast expanses of the continent, becoming a danger to careless wanderers.

    The continent fell barren, contaminated by arcane energies and even null.
    Inhabitants, like the Elves, Durag, Humans and others were forced to flee towards the coastal regions, leaving behind their empires.
