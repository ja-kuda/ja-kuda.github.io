    <h1>The age of Flight</h1>

    During the destruction brought onto the world by the Ascension and the wars preceding it, countless lives were lost and entire civilisations were destroyed.
    A glimmer of Hope however shone on the horizon, the possibility of a new beginning.
    To reach it however, the remaining Elves, Humans, Durag and all of the other creatures, had to survive the now treacherous and deadly Taurora and flee from it, to another place.

    <h2>A continent dying</h2>

    With each passing day, live on Taurora became more and more impossible.
    Arcane storms ravaged the landmass, leaving rifts and tears in their wake, monsters were born and began roaming the vast expanses of the continent, becoming a danger to careless wanderers.

    The continent fell barren, contaminated by arcane energies and even null.
    Inhabitants, like the Elves, Durag, Humans and others were forced to flee towards the coastal regions, leaving behind their empires.

    <h2>The flight to Kontralos</h2>

    Not many survived the journeys across the now called dead ocean, hunted by monsters and behemoths, thrown of course or destroyed by arcane storms or simply lost to the sea, only a handful of those that set out to safe their civilisations, managed to reach their goal of Kontralos.
    This small and magical continent was far less affected by the Ascension and provided the perfect environment for a new beginning.

    While the elves, Durag, Korna and many other cultures fled the dying continent, the humans, having been decimated especially hard, were left behind, just as the feared and misunderstood creations of Orvos, the Orvosa.
    They should endure many centuries of hardship and more than once were only a single step away from being lost completely.
