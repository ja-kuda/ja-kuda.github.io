    <h1>The Age of Ascension</h1>

    A long, long time ago, the first hints of sentience were born and quickly gained traction.
    Civilisations and empires rose and fell, the continent of Taurora became a bustling hub of life and magic and progress, but also conflict.
    Often called the First Age, it indicates the beginning of Akudia as it is known today and marks many important events that would shape the rest of history in their wake.

    <h2>The early gods</h2>

    During the early times many concepts were still new to Akudias inhabitants, such as the Arcane, the concept of souls and also faith.
    Born from nothing, Ambitions bagn to arose in them, criving individuals to seek out knowledge and power, followers flocking to their sides, supporting them in their struggles.
    Many of them were gifted with strong Arcane abilities, which they used to control and manipulate reality to their whim.

    <h2>Ascension wars</h2>

    The more of them gained status, power and followers, the more tensions arose, not soon after, terrible wars broke out, plunging Taurora into tumult.
    Wars were fought, lifes were sacrificed and thrown away and those that managed to be victorious, became even more powerful.
    <br>
    They began calling themselves gods, gaining more and more followers and creating more and more conflict around them in pursuit of their Ambitions.

    <h2>Ascension</h2>

    The wars culminated in the almost synchronized ascension of a dozen or more of these gods, making them ethereal embodiments of their Ambitions and in their wake, ripping open reality, throwing Akudia off balance.
    Some of them desperately tried to keep their physical forms, trying to stop their ascension by killing their followers while others tried to destroy reality itself to stop their dematerialization.
    Many of them however welcomed their ascension with open arms, becoming what we know today as the ascended gods.

    Akudia would be forever changed, as the Ascension created violent magical explosions, altering the continent of Taurora permanently and killing thousands, if not millions.
    Arcane storms erupted, magical creatures and monstrosities were suddenly created and mutated and in some parts the veil ripped apart, giving way to Null, ravaging the continent further.

    Those that survived scrambled to survive and flee the dying continent of Taurora, seeking a way to safe themselves.

    <h2>The Rifts emerge</h2>

    After the Ascension and ist consequences began to cool off, silence fell over Akudia.
    The fabric of reality slowly began to heal, but it seemed to have become thinner, almost as if it was being stretched over the holes that were created during the Ascension.
    These tears would still sometimes rip open, creating rifts, and reality would certainly never fully heal from one of the most important events in Akudias histoy.
