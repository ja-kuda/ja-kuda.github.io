    <h1>Rogamons Reign</h1>
    Many centuries of peace followed the demise of the elves, as two great realms arose.
    The great Kingdom of Varland and the Alliance of Atania split up the continent between them and coexisted peacefully for hundreds of years until they were brought down by a single man.
    <br>
    All of their wealth and power amounted to nothing, as they were plunged into more than 250 years of darkness, brought upon them by their excess and fear of the unknown.

    <h2>Nekromancy's cradle</h2>

    Long before the man named Rogamon was even born, another one stumbled upon something that would change the fate of the world forever.
    He did the previously unthinkable and discovered a way to manipulate and use a new element of reality.
    <br>
    By gaining access to Limbo, one of the many splinter worlds of Akudia, the one where Aestor holds the souls of the departed to decide their fates, he managed to use the energy of life and death itself to fuel his arcane prowess.
    This ultimately allowed him to thwart death itself and he created the first undead, a creature reborn without a soul.
    <br><br>
    The more he experimented with this new form of magic, the more he discovered that children with a similar gift of using the element were born.
    What he did not notice was the fabric of reality warping and the borders between Limbo and Reality itself thinning.
    <br><br>
    He began teaching those he found on his journeys the ways of using this power for good, but alas, he should be remembered in history as the Lord of Tears, named after all of the tears that would be shed during the next centuries, for which many made him responsible.

    <h2>The great Purge</h2>

    More and more children were born with the abilities to control the life element, the practice of which was named Nekromancy.
    And as more and more of them used their powers, for example to speak with loved ones, physical labor or healing the wounded, the more the rulers and nobles began fearing them.
    <br>
    As many of the rich and powerful had arcane abilities themselves, they resented puny commoners and rabble meddling with powers that were - from their point of view - reserved for them.
    <br><br>
    The king of Varland at the time set out a decree and many of his vassals followed his call to persecute and imprison any child that showed these abilities.
    Soon the great purge saw hundreds, if not thousands of children taken from their families and killed, locked away and sometimes even experimented on.
    <br><br>
    One of these children was a young boy from the streets of Norvall, one of the greatest cities of Varland at the time.
    He was transported to Winterglehn and thrown into a dungeon to be forgotten.

    <h2>Conquest of Winterglehn</h2>

    The boy from the dungeon however did not die in the catacombs, but instead broke free with the use of, until then never heard of, powers over the life element.
    Almost playful he freed himself and other prisoners and fled the city.
    <br><br>
    A few years went by and he returned, an army of undead soldiers and corpses in tow.
    He demanded to be brought before the king and as he was denied, began slaughering his way through the city until he reached the castle.
    <br>
    The more guards and soldiers fell to his army and his powers, the more his numbers grew, as every fallen was resurrected and joined his ranks.
    <br><br>
    As he finally reached the crown hall of the king of Winterglehn, he discovered the throne empty, the king having seemingly fled the city.
    He crowned himself King Rogamon, the king of Winterglehn, and soon of all of Kontralos.
