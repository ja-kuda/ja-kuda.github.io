    <h1>The time of Rifts</h1>

    The already damaged and weakened fabric of reality was further ripped apart by Rogamons actions and as a result, became more unstable than ever before.
    The opening of Rifts became more common and some places like the plains of silence became contaminated by arcane and null energies, similar to Taurora.
    <br>
    And although the imminent threat of Rogamon and his terrible reign had come to an end, the continent would not be allowed to heal for a long time.
    <br><br>
    The time of rebuilding and healing had just begun, the remnants of the great realms Varland and Atania and its people were free after decades of opression and darkness.
    New rulers were appointed and Nekromancy was outlawed and its users hunted down mercilessly, as to prevent a new uprising.
    The remaining undead, now without their masters disbanded and were destroyed or expelled in the following years.
    <br><br>
    Slowly but surely, normality returned to Kontralos.

    <h2>The Tralian Empire</h2>

    When Nekromancy was outlawed and forbidden in the realms of Kontralos, many voices pleaded to expand this ban onto other forms of magic as well, as they realized, that no single person should wield that much power.
    Internal conflict arose, as many of the great houses and the powerful rulers of the many realms were of arcane descents and the sitting king decided to not allow any kind of prosecution of arcanes other than those using the life element.
    <br><br>
    A big part of the great kingdom of Varland began revolting against their new king as they thought it too dangerous to let arcanes live and use their powers ever again.
    From this conflict, an open rebellion and a civil war sprung forth, permanently dividing the people of Kontralos.
    <br>
    It ended with the secession of the province of Tralia, which became the Tralian empire, devoted to protecting Kontralos from the dangers of arcanes.

    <h2>Splintering Kingdoms</h2>

    This lead to wars and conflicts and the ever expanding Tralian Empire soon began cleansing all of those that were talented in the arcane arts.
    Many rulers should come and go until a fragile peace could be brokered.

    <br><br>

    Until then, the Imperium conquered a sizeable chunk of land in the middle of the continent and be it through corruption of a greater plan, soon turned out to be eerily effective in rounding up and neutralizing arcanes within their borders.
    Borders which should time and time again be expanded and three bloody wars were fought between the Imperium and their former kingdom of Varland.

    <h2>The null Incident</h2>

    Around ten years ago, during a time of relative stability and peace, something big happened.
    Beltheim, a cultural hotspot and beacon of knowledge in the Kingdom of Varland, was destroyed.
    <br><br>
    Surrounding the city, which was built into a cliff face of the Schnitter mountains, lied fields of stabilised null crystals.
    The city and subsequently the whole kingdom used them as a way to create magical items and as a way to control and strengthen magic.
    Mines and quarries littered the fields around the scars as the canyons and holes were called.
    And although most knew the risks involved with mining and using these crystals, nobody could foresee what happened next.

    <br><br>

    Without warning a chain reaction was triggered by a fight between a powerful arcane and a group of unknown heroes which lead to a magical explosion akin to that of a gods ascension.
    The city and the surrounding fields were destroyed, the mountain face almost crashing down.
    What remains are the crystalline heart and an area that is uninhabitable, as the null magic that was locked into the crytsals broke free and created a permanent rift in reality.
    If it is not contained, it will continue to rip open and grow, contaminating more and more of the world.

    <h2>Rogamons Return</h2>

    Only a year after the null incident, another event shocked the world.
    Rogamon returned, reborn from a nekromantic ritual after he could not be defeated by the thirteen heroes, he awoke in Winterglehn, determined to regain his lost power and finally ascend to godhood.
    <br><br>
    But once again he was thwarted, during his ascension, the same group of heroes that were respinsible for the null incident, managed to corner the nekromancer under the city and interrupted his ascension.
    Many lost their lives, but one of them sacrificed their soul to eternally bind Rogamon, not being able to kill him, but at least keeping him from ascending fully.
