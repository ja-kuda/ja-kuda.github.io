    <h1>The history of Akudia</h1>

    No one knows exactly since when Akudia exists or what came before it, too many generations lived and died in this world, countless stories have been told and will be told in the future, with most being long lost to time.
    Some stories however became history, as the events in them essentially shaped the world of Akudia.

    <br><br>

    Some of the most important events are listed in the chapters below, keep in mind, that these are only a small fraction of the events that happened during Akudias existence, and that many more stories are yet to be told.
