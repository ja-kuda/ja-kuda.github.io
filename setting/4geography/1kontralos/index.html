    <h1>Kontralos</h1>

    When massive parts of the world were destroyed and made uninhabitable during the Ascension, Kontralos was among the few landmasses that stayed mostly unaffected, only bearing some of the scars of the creation of the gods.
    <br>
    Hailed as the last bastion of hope for civilised life, it was the destination of those that escaped Taurora amidst the chaos and destruction.

    <br><br>

    During the time of flight and the following centuries, the elves bacem the defacto rulers of the continent and although they remained friendly with all of the other refugees, they used their powers of biological creation to great effect.
    Intimidated and threatened, other cultures subjected themselves to them and were even able to keep to themselves and to their culture and society as long as they did not threaten the elves rule of Kontralos.
    <br>
    This all changed when the humans came to Kontralos, quickly conquering the continent and exterminating the elves.

    <br><br>

    Kontralos is characterized by a relatively small size and varied climate and geography.
    Icy plains, tundra, mountain ranges and grasslands transition smoothly into steppes, thick jungles and woodlands and even deserts.
    <br>
    Most of the Continent is inhabited by humans, Durag, Hinan and Orvosa, as well as most of the other sentients.
    There are of course some exceptions, the Frozen Wastes in the far north, the hungering sands in the deep south, as well as the Tralian wildernis which is home to many of the displaced undead that were created by Rogamon.

    <br><br>

    The western side of the continent in general is far more highly populated as most of the shipping and trade routes with the splinter islands, Ankhalat, but also the other powerful cities lie on this side.
    <br>
    The dead ocean marks a dangerous and often times deadly journey across to the ravaged lands of Taurora, a journey that only fools contest.

    <br><br>

    Two great mountain ranges split the continent into three parts, each being home to one of the three great realms, the Great Kingdom of Varland, the Tralian Empire and the Free Alliance of Atania.
    The former and latter of them are split up again into smaller vasall states and provinces and Atania especially has no king or single ruler to show.
