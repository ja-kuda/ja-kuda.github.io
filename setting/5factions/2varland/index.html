    <h1>Factions in the great kingdom of Varland</h1>

    The great kingdom of Varland is composed of several provinces, ruled by loyal vassalls to the king.
    The last decades however created tensions and recent events lead to a break in this loyalty.
    <br>
    Though the provinces are still subordinate to the king in name, they began turning away, when the king ordered some regions to be thrown to the wolves as the Tralian Empire began their conquest.
    <br><br>
    The king, in times of peace a reasonable and kind man, withdrew his troops and military might from the frontlines and barricades himself behind the springstone mountains.
    His rule encompasses Triften, the Division, the Oldenlands and Dragons Glen, where he sits on his throne in Hammerfall.
    <br><br>
    The kingdoms culture can be best described as stoic and proud

    <h2>The new Expansion</h2>

    When Rogamons return plunged Winterglehn and the surrounding lands into chaos, the king began abandoning the provinces and a new war broke out in the south of the realm, a mysterious figure emerged.
    They took control of Silbertal and the old Expansion with the help of sellswords and mercenaries and began ruling the provinces as if they were a king.
    For now they remain in the shadows.
    <br><br>
    While the Expansion was a hub of trade and crafts, home to the kingdoms most important harbor in Winterglehn, the Silbertal presented the exact opposite.
    A poor region and often forgotten, it was the birthplace of a cult that sought to revive Rogamon.
    <br><br>
    Despite everything, the new Expansion is once again a blooming and multicultural land, rife with opportunities for those that dare.

    <h2>The red-white Alliance</h2>

    When the Tralian Empire began its war of conquest on the southern borders on Varland to eradicate magic on the continent for good and the king abandoned the southern provinces to keep safe in the north, an alliance of necessity was born.
    The regions of Whitecoast and the red marsh, usually divided and without much in common, allied themselves together to try and defend the Imperiums attacks.
    <br><br>
    Whitecoast, a wealthy province, rife with valuable raw materials and experts craftsmen, and located on a nearly unassailable steep coast, was always home to art and beaty in the kingdom.
    <br>
    In the red marshes on the other hand, military and war shapes the life of many, always under threat from the Tralian Empire.

    <h2>The 13 stalwart ones</h2>

    Not many had the courage to openly resist Rogamons rule and some of them actively tried to topple him.
    One of them was the young lord Rabenhorst, who saw the imminent threat of Rogamons Ascension and gathered allies and friends to make a desperate last stand.
    <br><br>
    And they were successful, thwarting the mad kings Ascension, but losing their lifes and souls in the process.
    Their sacrifice however was not in vain, as it brought the light back to Kontralos and although they could not hold Rogamon forever, they are still remembered as the greatest heroes of Kontralos.

    <h2>The cabal</h2>
    Lead by a conclave of powerful mages and nekromancers this cult made it their goal to unearth and resurrect King Rogamon and aid him in his Ascension.
    They were almost successful and could only be stopped by a heroic sacrifice.
    <br><br>
    Their leaders were killed or went into hiding, but in some parts of Silbertal there are still some marauding bands of ravenclad bandits to be found.
