    <h1>Character Creation</h1>

    After learning all of the relevant mechanics and aspects of a character, it is time to learn how to create a character by filling them with numbers and specifics.
    This chapter will lead you through the process of creating characters in a fast and easy way, so you can start playing them in your games.
    
    <br><br>

    To start with character creation, begin by imagining your character, their looks, personality and characteristics, before you begin building them from the building blocks in the following chapters.
    With a clear idea in mind you will find it easier to put the pieces together that will become important during the game.
    
    <br><br>

    If you want to build your character first and later add a personality and characteristics instead, that is of course also a valid option and can be used to create memorable characters while being inspired by the character options.
    
    <br><br>
    
    After (or before) you have your character concept in mind, follow these steps to create your character:
    
    <br><br>

    <ol>
      <li><strong>Ambition:</strong> Choose an Ambition for your character, this can be either one from the list of example Ambitions or one that you thought of yourself, in which case you should check in with your GM. You can also note down one or more aspects in which your character pursues their ambition.</li>
      <li><strong>Ancestry:</strong> Choose an ancestry for your character. The chosen ancestry determines the characters health and ancestry talents, as well as other traits and bonuses.</li>
      <li><strong>Resolve:</strong> All characters start with 2 maximum resolve.</li>
      <li><strong>Skills:</strong> Determine your characters skills. All skills start at 1. You can choose 5 skills to increase to 2. You can also choose to reduce up to 2 skills to 0 to increase up to 2 different skills by +1, to a maximum of 3.</li>
      <li><strong>Arcane threads:</strong> Gain arcane threads equal to 3x your arcane skill.</li>
      <li><strong>Talents:</strong> Choose 3 talents that you meet the prerequisites for.</li>
      <li><strong>Boons and Flaws:</strong> Choose 4 traits for your character, as well as 3 boons and 3 flaws.</li>
      <li><strong>Equipment:</strong> Choose your starting equipment, based on your background and the type of story you want to tell, you are maybe restricted in what you can choose or buy as starting equipment. The GM should be able to tell you how much equipment you can choose.</li>
    </ol>
