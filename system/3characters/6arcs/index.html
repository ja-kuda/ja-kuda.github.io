    <h1>Arcs</h1>
    During the game and the story, each character can pursue their ambition in different ways, one of them being arcs, small, personal side-quests for each character in a party.
    They are used to strengthen the characters pursuit of their ambition and allow them to increase their maximum resolve over the course of a campaign, making them stronger and better equipped for their adventures.

    <h2>Creating character Arcs</h2>
    
    The players create these arcs together with the GM, based on their own goals for their characters and the current state of the story that is being told.
    When you first enter a segment of the story, work with your GM to create an arc that fits your characters ambition and goals, as well as the surrounding circumstances.
    
    <br><br>

    These arcs can be "bringing a lovers pair together" for a character with the love ambition, or maybe "prevent a war from breaking out" for a character with the peace ambition.
    Due to the nature of these arcs, they can be chosen in a way that fits the current theme and setting of the story.
    
    <br><br>

    Arcs should be chosen in a way that leaves some room for interpretation on the GMs part and also should not be something that can be resolved immediately, but instead take a few sessions to finish.
    This way it can be ensured, that the arcs have some impact on the characters personal stories and also that they can not be abused to always increase the characters maximum resolve.

    <h2>Starting a new Arc</h2>
    
    Only once every character in a group achieved their arcs goal, can the players choose new arcs for their characters.
    To prevent a single character to complete arc after arc, a new arc can only be created, after each character in a party fulfilled their own goals.
    This way, characters that already completed their arc, are incentivized to help and support their fellow party members in their arcs.
