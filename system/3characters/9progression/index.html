    <h1>Character Progression</h1>
    
    After you are done with character creation there are still ways for you to increase your characters power or change them up by adding new talents, increasing skills or otherwise attaining new abilities to experiment and play with.
    There are 3 ways in which characters can become stronger:

    <br><br>
    
    <strong>Character arcs</strong>
    <br>
    Whenever a character successfully finishes their personal arc, they increase their maximum resolve by 1.
    For more information on arcs, head back to chapter \hyperref[sec:ambition]{\ref{sec:ambition}}.

    <br><br>
    
    <strong>Level Ups</strong>
    <br>
    Interacting with the main story and finishing quests and tasks to further the goals of the group as a whole, allows characters to gain levels.
    Levels are not tracked and it is not important what level a character is exactly, as level ups serve only one general purpose: Gaining new talents.

    <br><br>
    
    After each major story development, be it the rescue of a princess from a dragons keep, a successful negotiation between two realms or the end of the search of a long lost NPC, the players gain a level and with that the ability to add another talent to their characters.
    
    <br><br>
    
    If a particular leg of the story stretches longer than 3 to 5 sessions, the GM could choose to allow the players to choose a new talent before the end of a major story development or during downtime for example.
    How many talents the characters can accumulate this way is up to the GM and the main story of the game.

    <strong>Free progression</strong>
    <br>
    Interacting with the world allows the characters to gain additional training in the form of skill increases or the accumulation of boons and flaws.
    Paying a mentor or using downtime to train, as well as certain items or effects allow for the characters to gain some of these bonuses every few sessions.
    
    <br><br>
    
    Free progression should always be based on the roleplay of the players and incorporate their characters training and opportunities during the story.
