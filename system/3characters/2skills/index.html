    <h1>Skills</h1>
    <br>
    Every character has access to 11 distinct skills, covering most, if not all possible actions they could take during the game.
    They can be roughly divided into physical, mental and social skills, there is however some overlap, as often multiple skills can be used for certain actions, based on the players descriptions of their characters activities.
    
    <br>
    <br>

    All skills range from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>5</strong> and determine the number of d8 rolled in a check of the required skill.
    A skill with 0 does not roll 0d8, but instead 1d6.
    
    <br>
    <br>

    During character creation all skills start with a 1 and can be increased to a certain degree.
    During the game they can be increased further by training the skills area of expertise or by choosing specific talents that increase them.
