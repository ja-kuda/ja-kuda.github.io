    <h1>Characters</h1>

    This chapter includes all of the necessary details and rules for creating characters and shows you all of the different attributes and stats that make up the character sheet.
    You will notice that some of these aspects will be detailed later on in the rules, as they are useful not only for character creation, but also the game as a whole, like magic of injuries.

    Besides the basics, this chapter is most important for the players that will create and play characters during the game and as such should be read carefully and diligently, as it is the players job to know and steer their character.
    This is only possible if they know what their character can and can not do, what the different things on their character sheet mean and of course what they can expect from their choices.
