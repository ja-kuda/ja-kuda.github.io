    <h1>Talents</h1>

    To allow for deeper mechanical depth than just a few skills and specializations, the players have access to a multitude of special abilities, called talents.
    Their characters can learn them during character creation and as each time they level up, granting them unique and interesting options to choose from.
    Talents bring a character concept together and make up most of the power budget of a character.
    They can be combined in any way the players see fit and while some talents have prerequisites, before they can be learned, there are almost no restrictions as to what talents can be chosen by the players to complete their character concept.

    The talents range from simple training with certain types of weapons like swords or bows, over crafting special items and infusing them with otherworldly power, to controlling the arcane itself, using it to create powerful spells and magical effects.
    Other abilities let you escape dangerous situations, refresh your resolve with additional triggers, or even allow you to manipulate the dice you roll on your checks.
    There are even some outlandish talents for your crazy character ideas, maybe you want to create a pyromaniac that sets themselves on fire before running into their enemies to fight them.
    With a little experimenting you will surely find a talent or two that support your ideas.
    
    <br><br>

    The possibilities to choose from are nigh endless, especially when considering the ability of the GM and the players creating their own talents fitting for their vision of fun and special characters.
