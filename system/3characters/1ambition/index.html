    <h1>Ambition</h1>

    Ambitions make up the core of the player characters and can be used as a guide and as inspiration for the characters motivation and how they will interact with the world of the game, as well as give some minor mechanical benefits.
    Since Ambitions are relevant for recovering Resolve, setting out character arcs and give a general direction, the characters are going and growing in, they should be chosen with care, since they are designed to be relatively permanent.
    Of course Ambitions can also be changed later on, but the characters should usually have a good reason and strong convictions, as to why that is necessary, which can make for interesting scenarios during the game.
    
    <br><br>

    Ambitions come in many forms and can cover a lot of topics, the most common Ambitions are broad concepts, like friendship, greed, power, freedom, justice, solace, etc. and more tangible aspects like family, war, money, food, home, etc.
    There are no strict rules for choosing an Ambition and the players should not feel restricted by them, instead using them as guidelines and helping hands for acting out their characters.
    Characters can have all manner of other traits, feelings, guidelines and complexity, but one of those will usually stand out amongst the rest.
    Think of Ambitions as a way to give your characters purpose and direction in a single concept.
    
    <br><br>

    Choosing Ambitions also allows the GM to more easily identify one of your characters most important aspects and use them to create more engaging stories and quests.
    
    <br><br>

    When you create a character choose an Ambition and which aspect of it you want your character to embody.
    You can use the following list as inspiration or choose your very own Ambition:

    <h2>Character arcs</h2>
    During the game and the story, each character can pursue their ambition in different ways, one of them being arcs, smaller, personal side-quests for each character in a party.
    They are used to strengthen the characters pursuit of their ambition and allow them to increase their maximum resolve over the course of a campaign, making them stronger and better equipped for their adventures.

    <h2>Creating character Arcs</h2>
    
    The players create these arcs together with the GM, based on their own goals for their characters and the current state of the story that is being told.
    When you first enter a segment of the story, work with your GM to create an arc that fits your characters ambition and goals, as well as the surrounding circumstances.
    
    <br><br>

    These arcs can be "bringing a lovers pair together" for a character with the love ambition, or maybe "prevent a war from breaking out" for a character with the peace ambition.
    Due to the nature of these arcs, they can be chosen in a way that fits the current theme and setting of the story.
    
    <br><br>

    Arcs should be chosen in a way that leaves some room for interpretation on the GMs part and also should not be something that can be resolved immediately, but instead take a few sessions to finish.
    This way it can be ensured, that the arcs have some impact on the characters personal stories and also that they can not be abused to always increase the characters maximum resolve.
