    <h1>Ambition</h1>

    Ambitions make up the core of the player characters and can be used as a guide and as inspiration for the characters motivation and how they will interact with the world of the game, as well as give some minor mechanical benefits.
    Since Ambitions are relevant for recovering Resolve, setting out character arcs and give a general direction, the characters are going and growing in, they should be chosen with care, since they are designed to be relatively permanent.
    Of course Ambitions can also be changed later on, but the characters should usually have a good reason and strong convictions, as to why that is necessary, which can make for interesting scenarios during the game.

    Ambitions come in many forms and can cover a lot of topics, the most common Ambitions are broad concepts, like friendship, greed, power, freedom, justice, solace, etc. and more tangible aspects like family, war, money, food, home, etc.
    There are no strict rules for choosing an Ambition and the players should not feel restricted by them, instead using them as guidelines and helping hands for acting out their characters.
    Characters can have all manner of other traits, feelings, guidelines and complexity, but one of those will usually stand out amongst the rest.
    Think of Ambitions as a way to give your characters purpose and direction in a single concept.

    Choosing Ambitions also allows the GM to more easily identify one of your characters most important aspects and use them to create more engaging stories and quests.

    When you create a character choose an Ambition and which aspect of it you want your character to embody.
