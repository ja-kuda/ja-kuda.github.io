    <h1>Traits, Boons and Flaws</h1>

    The skills on your character sheet are generalized and each one of them covers a variety of actions.
    To further determine a characters specializations and to make them unique, the following three sections of the character sheet are used.

    <br><br>

    While traits are mostly used to further characterize a character, boons and flaws offer tangible effects during the gameplay of Ambition, as they increase or decrease the size of dice in a given check.
    Boons and flaws are the mechanical benefits or detriments of a character and a central part of rolling checks during the game.

    <h2>Traits</h2>

    Traits are a characters characteristics so to speak. They are determined mostly by their worldview, the way they engage with people and problems, their nature and everything else that
    might make them stand out from among others.
    <br>
    These traits are neutral in nature and are rarely exchanged or removed.
    During a characters life they can of course chnage their traits and the players can choose to add or remove them thorugh their roleplay choices, but these changes take time and effort to become permanent.

    <br><br>

    During the game traits can be used by the player to help them roleplaying their character, as well as being used by the GM during checks.
    Whenever a check might be influenced by a characters trait, such as non-violence for example, the GM can choose to add a boon or flaw, depending on the situation.
    Adding a boon or flaw this way only adds them to the current check and they disappear immediately after the check is made.

    <h2>Boons</h2>

    Boons represent something a character is especially good at, like climbing, public speaking, or maybe using a certain type of weapon.
    Whenever a check is made and a character has boons that fits the situation of the check, they can use one or more boons to improve the size of a number of dice equal to the used boons by 1 stage each.
    A d8 for example becomes a d10 when a boon is used, another boon can improve it to a d12. When rolling more than one die, the player can choose the improvement from each boon seperately.
    This can be done as often as possible, but each die can only be improved up to a d12.

    <br><br>

    Boons usually last an indefinite amount of time (unless the GM adds more through traits, circumstances, difficulty, etc.).
    Some boons however are temporary or can only be used a certain number of times.
    These boons are usually gained through talents. These talents will tell you exactly how these boons work.

    <br><br>

    Boons do not have to be used, you can always choose which check you want to use a boon on, as long as the boon fits the check.

    <br><br>

    The GM can call a check to be made with a number of boons in addition to the ones on a characters sheet.
    These boons can be based on the characters traits, the enviroinment they are in when rolling the check or any other circumstances and are only usable in the check they are called in.

    <h2>Flaws</h2>

    Flaws are the polar opposite of boons, detriments to a character which impair dice, reducing their size by 1 stage instead.
    A d8 becomes a d6 with one flaw and a d4 with two. All other rules from boons also apply, though usually in the opposite direction.

    <br><br>

    Flaws are gained in a variety of ways, sometimes they represent things a character might struggle with, like reading, swimming or a certain element.
    Other flaws are gained when a character is injured. Lvl 2 wounds add a flaw based on the injury that lasts as long as the injury impacts the character.

    <br><br>

    Keep in mind, while boons can be used voluntarily, flaws must be used in all checks they are befitting and always as soon as possible.

    <br><br>

    The same way the GM can call a check to be made with a number of additional boons, the same goes for flaws. Especially dangerous or difficult tasks can lead to the GM 
    asking the player to make a check with a flaw in addition to all other boons or flaws that might apply from the character sheet.
