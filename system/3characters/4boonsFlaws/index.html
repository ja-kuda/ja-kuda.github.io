    <h1>Boons and Flaws</h1>

    While skills represent universal abilities and knowledge, most characters have many more specialized fields of expertise, as well as areas where their abilities fall short in.
    To allow the players to create more complex and detailed characters they can use boons and flaws.
    These attributes of a character not only serve to flesh out the personality and make them unique in a role-play sense, but also add mechanical depth to the characters.
    
    <br>
    <br>

    Boons and Flaws are mainly used to increase or decrease the size or type of one or more dice in a check that relates to them.
    They can be stacked, meaning that multiple boons or flaws with the same name, or if multiple different ones fit a certain check, allow you to modify multiple dice.
    <br>
    2 Boons for example can increase 2d6 in a check to 2d8 or to 1d6 + 1d10.
    Many combinations are possible the more boons and flaws are applicable for a check.

    <br><br>

    <strong>Keep in mind that while boons can be used voluntarily, flaws must be used whenever and as soon as possible!</strong>
    
    <br>
    <br>

    Some examples for boons and flaws can be: riding horses, swimming, climbing, lockpicking, intimidation, light weapons, use of swords, a certain language, teaching children,
     critical thinking, impulse control, hiding, comedy, lying, running, agility, influence, armor etc.

    Boons and Flaws are an important step during character creation and help in fleshing out a characters personailty as well as strengths and weaknesses.
    They are meant as opportunities for the players to add additional flavor and opportunities to their characters besides their ambitions and ancestry.

    <h2>Types of Boons and Flaws</h2>
    Boons and flaws do not necessarily have to be of a permanent nature, some of them can also be only temporary, such as blinded or drunk.
    Temporary boons and flaws are removed after a certain time or if the character spends time and actions to remove the effects themselves.
    <br>
    Flaws that are gained from wounds fall under this category.
    <br><br>
    Some boons and flaws are more powerful than others and come with a number, like for example: climbing x3, meaning that this boon or flaw modifies 3 dice at once.
    <br><br>
    Other boons and flaws might be only usable a certain number of times.
    Characters can choose in which check to use these boons and after they do, they are removed.
    <br><br>
    Permanent boons and flaws usually have no time or use limit, but they can also be removed or altered.
    The characters actions determine to what effect in this case.

    <h2>GM handing out Boons and Flaws</h2>
    While the player characters have a number of permanent or temporary boons and flaws that they are responsible for and can make use of in fitting checks, the GM can also make use of boons and flaws to change up the difficulty of checks.
    <br>
    By calling a for a check with a boon, the player that has to make the check, can increase a single die in addition to their characters boons and flaws when making a check.
    <br>
    Calling a check with flaws works just the same but reversed, decreasing a die regardless of a characters boons and flaws.
