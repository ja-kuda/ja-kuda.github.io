    <h1>Boons & Flaws</h1>

    While skills represent universal abilities and knowledge, most characters have many more specialized fields of expertise, as well as areas where their abilities fall short in.
    To allow the players to create more complex and detailed characters they can use boons and flaws.
    These attributes of a character not only serve to flesh out the personality and make them unique in a role-play sense, but also add mechanical depth to the characters.
    
    <br>
    <br>

    Boons and Flaws are mainly used to increase or decrease the size or type of one or more dice in a check that relates to them.
    Boons and flaws can also have a number associated with them, written down like this: xX, where X is the number of times, this boon or flaw is counted in each check.

    <strong>Boons</strong>
    <br>
    Be it swimming, riding, translating, harvesting crops or training children, everything that a character is especially adept in is considered a boon.
    And although they still use the usual skills for checks relating to these areas, they can increase the size of 1 die per boon relating to that check, giving them an advantage when they take actions that relate to their strengths.
    
    <br>
    <br>

    <strong>Flaws</strong>
    <br>
    But all that is good also comes with some bad, just as characters have boons and strengths, they can not be perfect in everything.
    They can also have a number of flaws, weaknesses and shortcomings in certain areas that reduce a dies size for any check made relating to them.
    Most wounds that the characters gain during their adventures will also add some form of flaw to a character, based on the injury they suffered.

    <strong>Character boons and flaws</strong>
    <br>
    Boons and Flaws are an important step during character creation and help in fleshing out a characters personailty as well as strengths and weaknesses.
    Boons and flaws are meant as opportunities for the players to add additional flavor and opportunities to their characters besides their ambitions and ancestry.
    
    <br><br>

    Characters can gain new boons and flaws by training during downtime or by learning from their comrades or mentors.
    Details for that are found in chapter \hyperref[sec:progession]{\ref{sec:progression}}.
    
    <br><br>

    <strong>Wound flaws</strong>
    <br>
    Every wound a character gains also adds a number of flaws based on the injury that last until they are treated or healed.
    The wound level also determines the number of a flaw gained thorugh this injury.
    A lvl 2 wound for example adds a flaw x2 based on the location and type of injury.
    
    <strong>Status Boons and Flaws</strong>
    <br>
    Some conditions and effects can add boons and flaws to a character as well.
    Maybe a character gets some sand thrown in their eyes by their oppoenent and they become blinded for a time, gaining a flaw x2 for sight.
    Or maybe they cast a spell on themselves, allowing them to withstand poisons, gaining a boon x2 for endurance against poisons.
    These effects usually are of a temporary nature and can be inflicted by either conflict or friendly effects.
    
    <br><br>

    <strong>General boons and flaws</strong>
    <br>
    Usually a player is responsible for choosing and using the right boons and flaws during their checks, but sometimes the GM might want to add a little variation or needs to make a check a little bit hareder or easier than the scale of success allows for.
    Maybe they want to reward especially good role-play during an interrogation scene or show the might and prowess of an enemy in combat by adding boons or flaws for a single check.
    
    <br><br>

    When the GM calls for a check, they can call it any number of boons or flaws, which have to be used in the check and only last for a single check.
    
    <br>
    <br>

    <h2>Duration</h2>
    Boons and flaws do not necessarily have to be of a permanent nature, some of them can also be only temporary, such as blinded or drunk.
    Temporary boons and flaws are removed after a certain time or if the character spends time and actions to remove the effects themselves.
    
    Other boons and flaws might be only usable a certain number of times, most of them being single use.
    Characters can choose in which check to use these boons or flaws and after they do, they are removed.
    
    Permanent boons and flaws might have no time or use limit, but they can also be removed or altered.
    The characters actions determine to what effect in this case.
