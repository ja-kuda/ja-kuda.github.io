    <h1>Ancestries</h1>
    The world of Akudia is inhabited by a number of intelligent creatures, that range from the numerous and adaptable humans over the sturdy Durag and Korna, exotic Quabut and Gob, to the almost godlike but extinct elves.
    Adventurers and most other characters and NPCs you will create and interact with, originate from one of these ancestries.

    Each ancestry has certain benefits and drawbacks, detailed in the list below.
    An ancestry determines the characters starting health and adds special talents during character creation, called ancestry talents, as well as some boons and maybe even flaws.
    
    <div class="trenn"><img class="trennLine" src="images/line_6.png" alt="trenn"/></div>

    <h2>Human</h2>
    Humans are the most numerous and adaptive type of sentients in the world of Akudia and are often referred to as the locusts of the world.
    They dominated the continent of Kontralos since their arrival and the extinction of the true elves.
    This is largely due to their relentlessness and adaptability to the toughest conditions, which allows them to gain foothold in even the most inhospitable environments.
    Humans are driven by a thirst for action, this often leads to conflicts which are severe, but quick.
    Alliances between humans can be fickle, sometimes lasting centuries while other times falling apart almost instantly.
    
    <br><br>

    Playing as a human allows for varied character builds, their versatile talent allows the player to choose any talent from the list as long as the prerequisites are met and the rapid adaptability talent lets them be more flexible with their attributes while playing.
    
    <br><br>

    Humans have average health and are generally blank slates.
    This does not mean however, that humans can not make for interesting characters, quite the opposite is often the case.
    
    <br><br>

    As a human you gain:

    <br><br>
    
    <strong>Health</strong>
    <br>
    3 - 2 - 1

    <br><br>
    
    <strong>Versatility</strong>
    <br>

    <br><br>
    
    <strong>Rapid adaptability</strong>
    <br>

    <br>
    Also increase a skill by 1 at character creation.
    
    <div class="trenn"><img class="trennLine" src="images/line_4.png" alt="trenn"/></div>
    
    <h2>Durag</h2>
    Born of stone and mountains, Durag were once proud creatures, of whom little remains today.
    After the humans conquered the continent of Kontralos and the elves were extinguished, the Durag retreated deep into the earth and only remained on the surface in hidden or hard to reach regions.
    
    <br><br>

    It is noticeable that almost all Durag take on the properties of minerals, stones and crystals in the course of their lives, which they can consume as food.
    Especially old Durag are almost indistinguishable from stones and crystals, and at the end of their natural lifespan, Durag lie down and become one with the earth they were born from.
    
    <br><br>

    Durag are sociable and friendly, if only among each other and although the ancient history is mostly forgotten, some duragish enclaves still hold grudges against the humans for the sins of their ancestors.
    
    <br><br>

    Living mostly underground and in the dark has given Durag the ability of black and white vision, even in absolute darkness, as well as more durable bodies.
    They can consume special rocks and minerals to gain their properties.
    
    <br><br>

    As a Durag you gain:

    <br><br>

    <strong>Health</strong>
    <br>
    4 - 2 - 1
    
    <br><br>

    <br>
    You gain black and white vision, even in absolute darkness.

    Whenever you use this talent, consume a portion of rock, crystal, ore etc. and gain a status effect that is based on its type: magnetic, extra heavy, jagged, camouflaged, luminous.
   
    <div class="trenn"><img class="trennLine" src="images/line_11.png" alt="trenn"/></div>
    
    <h2>Orvosa</h2>
    Made in the image of a dark god and being late to arrive on Kontralos, the Orvosa where doomed to an existence on the outskirts of society.
    They were artifically created during the age of ascension as living weapons by the god Orvos. Their singular purpose was to destroy the followers of the other gods and secure their masters position as the mightiest of the gods.
    They were saved however, by another god of the name Inferna. She slew the dark god and thus gave the Orvosa freedom, which they still thank their deliverer deeply and with devotion for.
    
    <br><br>

    Both Orvos and Inferna were gods of emotion and power, the Orvosa are the result of the meddling of these gods, resulting in creatures that invoke primal feelings of fear and respect in those that see them and interact with them.
    Their horns, vibrant and differing skin colors and affinity for fire make the Orvosa imposing creatures of extremes.
    They can harness their emotions and share them with others and their presence can be enhanced by giving into their darker side.

    <br><br>
    
    As an Orvosa you gain:

    <br><br>
    
    <strong>Health</strong>
    <br>

    <div class="trenn"><img class="trennLine" src="images/line_1.png" alt="trenn"/></div>
    
    <h2>Hinan</h2>
    At first glance, Hinan can easily be mistaken for small humans, but a closer look quickly reveals some distinct differences.
    Hinan are one of the sentients that, along with the elves, Durag and Korna, were the first to arrive in Kontralos after the Ascension wars and soon began to live a life far removed from politics, wars and conflicts.
    
    <br><br>

    Mostly barely a metre tall, they prefer to live in remote areas and hard-to-reach places, such as the deep forests of the continent.
    There they simply live in large family clans and rarely venture into cities or larger settlements, mainly to trade.
    Hinan are known to be great craftsmen and tinkerers, and with the simple tools at their disposal, they like to create true masterpieces of engineering.
    
    <br><br>

    Due to their shyness and rarity in populated areas, Hinan are rumoured to bring good luck to those they encounter.
    Hinan are not as resilient or enduring as many of the 'great' ancestries on Akudia, but they make up for this with skill and the fact that there may be some truth in the tales of Hinan good fortune.
    
    <br><br>

    As a Hinan you gain:
    
    <br><br>

    <strong>Health</strong>
    <br>
    2 - 2 - 1
    
    <br><br>

    Increasing a full success increases it to a critical success.
    
    <div class="trenn"><img class="trennLine" src="images/line_7.png" alt="trenn"/></div>
    
    <h2>Korna</h2>
    The Korna of Kontralos once lived in relative peace in the northern realms and where a respected people of warriors and craftsmen.
    Though they have fiery blood and especially young men often lust for battle, they prospered under the rule of the true elves and controlled their own lands and regions until the humans arrived.
    Not long after the locusts of Kontralos reached the northern realms and kingdoms, bloody wars began when the humans tried to take control of the lands belonging to the Korna.
    Not many records remain of these wars but it is clear that the humans could not be stopped by them and the Korna were almost exterminated, with the remaining survivors being driven far into the northern lands and the icy desert, where they were forced to survive ever since.
    Only recently the Korna were allowed back into the human realms and slowly but surely integrate into the human centric society.
    
    <br><br>

    Korna are big and strong, resilient to survive the dangerous and deadly northern lands.
    They still keep their fiery hearts and lust for battle though, granting them advantages in combat.
    
    <br><br>
    
    As a Korna you gain:

    <br><br>
    
    <strong>Health</strong>
    <br>
    3 - 3 - 1
    
    <br><br>

    <strong>Resilience</strong>

    <div class="trenn"><img class="trennLine" src="images/line_3.png" alt="trenn"/></div>

    <h2>Half Giant</h2>
    The mountains of Akudia are home not only to monsters and dragons, but also sometimes to beings that can only be described as giant kin.
    
    <br><br>

    Humanoid in form, they tower above the other sentients and are veritable mountains of flesh and muscle.
    According to the legends, half-giants are said to have arisen from relationships between humans and giants, but hardly anyone knows exactly where they really come from.
    
    <br><br>

    With a height of up to 3.5 m, half-giants are simply too big for many towns and activities of the small crawlers, which is why they live in seclusion in their own societies and, to the outside observer, live there almost barbarically.
    Half giants are among the strongest and most resilient intelligent creatures on Akudia and can push themselves far beyond their limits to achieve their goals.
    
    <br><br>

    As a half giant you gain:

    <br><br>
    
    <strong>Health</strong>
    <br>
    3 - 3 - 2
    
    <br><br>

    <strong>Limit breaker</strong>
    <br>
    4 charges
    <br>
    You can push yourself to your limits, gaining +1 die. 
    <br>
    If more than one die rolls a 1 on that check you gain the fatigue status effect.
    
    <br><br>

    <strong>Regeneration</strong>
    <br>
    You are able to remove an additional lvl 1 wound per rest.
    
    <div class="trenn"><img class="trennLine" src="images/line_13.png" alt="trenn"/></div>

    <h2>Gob</h2>
    Gobs come in many flavours, colours and forms.
    Humanoid amphibians, reptiles and sometimes even fish, they have mostly two things in common:
    
    <br><br>

    They are swampdwellers or island folk and only rarely stray far from their homes and they live in complex hierarchies and societies that look remarkably like feudal power structures and manifest themselves in the Gob's nature, their biological need to serve a liege or strife to become one themselves.
    A Gob is bound by their liege, lord or king and can call upon them to ask for help, as they may call upon the Gob to serve them in a quest.
    
    <br><br>

    Most Gobs are relatively small and lean, every once in a while though they can grow to sizes of humans or even bigger.
    Their abilities vary based on their form, froglike Gob may be better suited for jumping and swimming, while turtlelike Gobs posess a hard shell which defends them from danger.
    
    <br><br>

    Gobs may not be the most resilient or powerful sentients on Akudia, but their abilities to inhabit their homelands and their "kingdoms" are unmatched, which makes them a dangerous foe, should you ever step foot into a swamp that is ruled by a tribe of Gobs.
    
    <br><br>

    As a Gob you gain:
    
    <br><br>

    <strong>Health</strong>
    <br>
    3 - 2 - 1
    
    <br><br>

    <strong>Gob's body</strong>
    <br>
    Gain a trait from the list:
    <br>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Frog:</strong> Your long and sticky tongue allows you to grab and pull items and small creatures with it.</li>
      <li><strong>Toad:</strong> Your skin secrets a poison that numbs on contact and can even paralyze when touched long enough.</li>
      <li><strong>Salamander:</strong> You can regrow a lost limb with an endurance check during your rest. This counts as healing wounds.</li>
      <li><strong>Alligator:</strong> You gain powerful jaws and can use them to attack with. Once you successully bite something, you can clamp down to stay on whatever you have bitten.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <br><br>

    <strong>Gob's nature</strong>
    <br>
    7 charges
    <br>
    You are bound to an oath to your liege or king.
    You can summon this oath to gain 3 boons on any check, binding yourself further to the oath.
    <br>
    The charges of this talent do not recharge on a rest, but instead you will receive a quest from your liege, once you used all charges. After you completed the quest, this talent will be recharged fully.
    
    <div class="trenn"><img class="trennLine" src="images/line_8.png" alt="trenn"/></div>

    <h2>Quabut</h2>
    Peaceful and isolated are the first words many a traveler thinks of when reporting of the weird and almost alien creatures known as Quabut.
    The jellyfish like humanoids ironically do not live in the sea or in the water at all, but instead inhabit the many deserts of Akudia, soaking up water in their bodies and traveling the scorching sands in the compounds of families and tribes.
    
    <br><br>

    Quabut seem mysterious and incomprehensible, speaking no known language or even communicating at all.
    Hidden from observing eyes though, they present one of the most complex structures, showing similarities to that of a hivemind, allowing the Quabut to communicate and share emotions, knowledge, memories and thoughts directly with their brethren and sisters.
    
    <br><br>

    It is unclear, whether these creatures have a concept of gender, leadership or society at all and thus keep to themselves.
    The few Quabut, that are split from their tribes, often do so, because of important missions or quests. Others have been exiled, forever cut off from the hive mind they called home before, dooming them to a live in isolation and loneliness.
    That is not to say, that Quabut can not find new and like-minded, that allow them to create a new hive mind of their own.
    
    <br><br>

    Quabut are surprisingly tough and can withstand scorching heat and even survive weeks, if not months without water, by simply storing it in their bodies.
    They are also able to telepathically communicate with other creatures outside of their tribes, this is however greatly restricted.
    
    <br><br>

    As a Quabut you gain:

    <br><br>
    
    <strong>Health</strong>
    <br>
    2 - 2 - 1
    
    <br><br>

    <strong>Boon</strong>

    <strong>Hive bonding</strong>
    <br>
    You can communicate telepathically with intelligent creatures.
    Additionally you can read the thoughts of nearby Quabut, but they can do the same to you.
    
    <br><br>

    <strong>Watery body</strong>
    <br>
    Instead of blood running through your veins, it is water that keeps you alive.
    You do not bleed and can store up to a weeks worth of water by submersing yourself fully.
    You can breathe in water and can choose to deal electric damage on contact if your body is filled with water.
    
    <div class="trenn"><img class="trennLine" src="images/line_2.png" alt="trenn"/></div>

    <h2>Elf</h2>
    The true rulers of Kontralos, immortal and elegant beings that saw a rapid and extreme decline when the humans began conquering the continent.
    They tried to withstand the growing threat of extinction, first by diplomacy and negotiations, but when it became clear, that their numbers dwindled further, many of them began fighting what they thought, was the cause of their demise.
    They lost, marking the end of the true elves and initiating a new era, one without them as the rulers.
    
    <br><br>

    Before they died though, the elves were known for their prowess in biological engineering and their ability to create life itself.
    The elves are responsible, not only for the wretches, dangerous parasitic spirits, but also for many of the dangerous lifeforms inhabiting Akudia, especially Kontralos.
    
    <br><br>

    Limited in their growth by a fixed number of existing elf souls, a new elf can only be born when another one dies, their soul returning to one of their soul anchors and imbuing a newborn elf with a soul, sometimes keeping experiences and memories intact.
    Most of the soul anchors were destroyed in the elven wars, but some of them could be restored and thus allow at least some of the elven souls to return to the world.
    
    <br><br>

    The elves are surprisingly tough and resistant, though their long and spindly forms might suggests otherwise.
    They are immune to virtually all disease and also aging, the trade-off being, that their numbers are limited.
    
    <br><br>

    As an elf you gain:
    
    <br><br>

    <strong>Health</strong>
    <br>
    3 - 2 - 1
    
    <br><br>

    <strong>Biological immunity</strong>
    <br>
    You are immune to illness and disease and you can not be infected by wretches against your will.
    
    <br><br>

    <strong>Immortal soul</strong>
    <br>
    As long as your soul is bound to a soul anchor, should you die, your soul will return to your soul anchor and you will be reborn in a new body.
    
    <div class="trenn"><img class="trennLine" src="images/line_5.png" alt="trenn"/></div>

    <h2>Undead</h2>
    When the nekromancer king Rogamon conquered and ruled the Kontinent of Kontralos for nearly 300 years, he created unthinkable numbers of undead for his armies and as his followers.
    Some of them were even blessed with intelligence and what resembled free will, to serve as his advisors and servants.
    Instead of the shambling zombies or rattling skeletons that were mostly associated with nekromancy up to this point, these creatures were something more and after the end of Rogamons reign, gained freedom of thought, broken were the shackles that binded them to the nekromancer king.
    Many of them were hunted in the years after the fall of their master, many more were killed and only some managed to live until today, secluded in solitary places and hidden from the eyes of undead hunters.
    There they managed to form small societies and created almost mockeries of real and living creatures, only rarely seeking out cities and towns, and only by using disguises or spells to mask their true origins.
    
    <br><br>
    
    Undead are blessed and cursed at the same time, their bodies being frail shells of what they were in life, but at the same time being unable to find rest.
    And though they mostly suppress these urges, they can consume living and recently deceased flesh of sentients to gain their knowledge.
    
    <br><br>

    As an undead you gain:
    
    <br><br>

    <strong>Health</strong>
    <br>
    0 - 2 - 0
    
    <br><br>

    <strong>Decaying body</strong>
    <br>
    Your body is dead and not affected by minor wounds. You ignore any lvl 1 wounds you suffer from damage.
    Your body however is also not as resilient against destruction anymore, you die when you gain a lvl 3 wound instead of a lvl 4 wound.
    
    <br><br>

    <strong>Soulless creation</strong>
    <br>
    You were created by nekromantic magic and can be revived by the same means. 
    You can skip all checks relating to resurrection if an arcane caster uses the life element and spends 7 arcane threads on a ritual to revive you.
    
    <br><br>

    <strong>Thoughts for food</strong>
    <br>
    You can consume a recently deceased sentient creature to gain their memories and thoughts. Roll a lore check to gain memories <span style="color: #9bbb59">dating back a few days</span> $\vert$ <span style="color: #c19c0b">of just before death</span>.
    
    <div class="trenn"><img class="trennLine" src="images/line_12.png" alt="trenn"/></div>

    <h2>Satyr</h2>
    Satyrs are the often overlooked and worked to death laborers of the lands of the fey.
    Hailing from a mirrored reality and slaves to mystical and powerful beings, they are weak on their own, possessing only small fractions of arcane powers and feeble bodies.
    Even together, they are often no match for their masters and thus always seek to escape their reality in search of a better and more importantly free life.
    Many satyrs would give prosperity and good health for the ability to make their own decisions and act of their own free will.
    
    <br><br>

    Some satyrs manage to enter the one reality through tears in the fabric of space and time and break free from their shackles.
    They are rare however, as not many successfully manage to make the journey into another world and even less are accepted into society.
    Those who do often experience lives that are not all that different to their past ones, but instead of cruel masters, they now are bound to their own survival, scrounging for money as jesters, workers or sometimes even courtesans.
    
    <br><br>

    Their short and often tragic lives make satyrs especially empathic to the struggles and hardships of others and will try to help wherever they can.
    As their bodies are relatively small and weak, satyrs make do with their innate magical talents, allowing them to teleport short distances or perform small arcane tricks with ease.
    
    <br><br>

    As a satyr you gain:
    
    <br><br>

    <strong>Health</strong>

    <h2>Karzion</h2>
    One of the most mysterious type of sentients in Akudia are for sure the Karzion, a race of glass-like beings, ethereal and alien to the common observer.
    They are however quite civilized and show a great deal of courtesy and manners when they interact with others.
    
    <br><br>

    Their movement can only be described as graceful and their beautiful looks make them coveted muses, partners and living art pieces.
    Their bodies however are not quite as fragile as they might seem.
    A Karzion possesses skin that is nearly as hard as diamond, but also brittle.
    They can withstand the hardest of blows, but can splinter from even the smallest of cuts if they are unlucky.
    
    <br><br>

    Karzion have the ability to bend the light around their bodies at will, allowing them to glow in all different colors and even making them almost invisible.
    They can also create small sections of glass like substance that split off from their body and can even live for a short time after.
    
    <br><br>

    As a Karzion you gain:

    <br><br>
    
    <strong>Health</strong>
    <br>
    1 - 2 - 3
    
    <br><br>

    <strong>Light bending</strong>
    <br>
    You can turn your body invisible at will, everything you wear or carry however will still be visible.
    
    <br><br>

    <strong>Glass splinters</strong>
    <br>
    You can fill a lvl 3 wound to split of a piece or your body. It acts as a companion for you until you reattach it, at which point the wound is removed. Wounds created by this talent can not be removed in any other way.
