    <h1>Health</h1>

    <br>

    Although it might sound macabre, each character has a set amount of wounds at their disposal.
    Wounds represent a characters health and physical well-being, kind of like HP in similar games.
    
    <br><br>

    A characters health determines their ability to withstand damage and survive risky situations, combat encounters and devastating spell effects.
    Wounds of differing levels, representing increasingly dangerous injuries and harm, make up a characters health.
    
    <br><br>

    Health is represented in the following format:
    
    <br><br>

    X - Y - Z
    
    <br><br>

    Each of these placeholders stands for a level of wounds:
    
    <br>

    <ul>
      <li>X represents level 1 wounds</li>
      <li>Y represents level 2 wounds</li>
      <li>Z represents level 3 wounds</li>
    </ul>

    <br>
    
    A characters health is mainly determined by their ancestry, but they can increase their health by learning specific talents or by gaining them during the game.
    A human character for example has a health of 3 - 2 - 1, which creates the following wounds on their character sheet:
    
    <br><br>

    <div class="trenn"><img class="textImage" src="images/wounds/wounds_empty.png" alt="trenn"/></div>
    
    <br><br>

    Whenever a character is hurt, takes damage or is injured, they gain 1 or more wounds of the different levels.
    Most of the time this is decided by the GM based on conflict resulting from failed or partially successful checks in one or more action scenes.
    If all available and viable wounds are filled when a character gains another wound, they will die.
