    <h1>About the Game</h1>
    <br>

    Ambition is a tabletop role-playing game that creates colorful and creative characters and throws them into a fantastical world full of adventure.
    In this fantasy world the characters experience adventures, intrigue, drama and so much more.

    <br>
    <br>

    The game aims to tell stories of heroic antics and high octane adventures.
    The players create the heroes or anti-heroes of these stories and guide them through the world of Akudia or any other fantasy setting they like, the rules can easily be transcribed to a multitude of other worlds, like seafaring adventures of a pirate crew, gunslinging steampunk cowboys or even prehistoric cavemen.
    The world of Akudia however offers the best fit for all mechanics and rules that are included in this system and with slight modifications you can make even this world your own!

    <br>

    The rules are designed in a way that keeps the focus of the game on the stories being told, many of them, like combat, movement, injuries and even magic are streamlined in such a way to keep a steady pace of new and exciting situations, as well as allow for maximum flexibility in the way these stories are told by the players.
    That is not to say, that there are no rules at all, there are still a number of mechanics and rulings that lay the groundwork for a fair experience during play.
    When playing the game, most of them are neatly packed into a conversation between the players, occasionally interrupted by rolling some dice to determine uncertain results and to add some unpredictability into the story.

    Creating characters is a quick and simple task that lets the players choose almost all of their attributes without restrictions and the ability to mix and match almost all aspects of a character from a steadily growing number of character options, allows for truly unique characters that will certainly meet the players expectations of their character concepts.

    <br>
    <br>

    And if all of the options for the players and GMs are not enough, there are simple ways to create your own content, be it new character options, items, spells, or entirely different rules!

    <br>
    <br>

    Ambition is definitely more of a fast and loose experience and those of you, that are looking for deep mechanics and crunching the numbers to optimize their experience, must be prepared to be disappointed.
    Those that love to improvise, either as a GM or player, will find a lot of room to let their creative spirits roam freely and all of you that are looking for a system that is easy to set up and quick to play, are hopefully satisfied, with what they find in this book.
