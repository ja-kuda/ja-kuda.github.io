    <h1>About the Game</h1>

    Ambition offers a simple to learn rule-set that allows for wacky and crazy adventures, during which colorful and fully customized characters come to life in exciting situations.
    Be it combat encounters against hordes of undead or massive behemoths, suspenseful heists and stealth missions or throwing a nobles ball, the possibilities are nigh endless.
    
    Ambition aims to emulate high octane and heroic fantasy adventures, during which the characters play the heroes of the story and overcome obstacles, enemies and the supernatural.
    Although Ambition can be adapted to a multitude of settings and types of stories, it is best used in magical fantasy settings, like "The world of Akudia".
    It can however, easily be adapted to more specific settings, like pirates or wild west.
    
    The rules are designed to allow for the creation of colourful and unique characters without many restrictions like classes or archetypes.
    During play the rules create a fast paced gameplay loop, neatly packaged into a conversation between the players, which is designed to allow for creativity to flow and give the players as much freedom to decide their characters fate and ways to engage with the story as possible.
    
    Ambition also offers inspiration and guidelines for GMs inside, be it the running of the game or the creation of new rules and content, like monsters, items, talents, etc.
