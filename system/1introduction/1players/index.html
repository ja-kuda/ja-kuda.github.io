    <h1>Players</h1>

    Ambition is a roleplaying game that is designed to be played as a group of at least 3 players.
    Depending on your time and playstyle, the optimal number of players lies between 4 and 7, you can of course play Ambition with more or less players, by your enjoyment might vary.

    Usually when talking about the players of this game, it means all participants.
    One of those players will have to take on a special role, that of the Gamemaster or GM for short.
    To make it easier to differentiate this special role and the other players, the word players in the following means all of those participants that create characters and interact with the world, while the GM directs the game by controlling the world.

    <h2>The Gamemaster</h2>

    The gamemaster, or GM for short, acts as manager and judge of the game and is in charge of everything that is not a player character.
    They keep the world running and are mostly responsible for creating scenes to create tension, drama, danger and situations for the players characters to thrive in.

    <br>

    A GMs task is to engage the players and control the game, but not necessarily the story, although they are responsible for keeping everything in order and - if necessary - reign in the players to keep the story moving forward.
    The do so by setting scenes, moments during the story, which are explained later on.

    <br><br>

    A GM should always be a fan of the characters and work with - not against - the players during the game.
    Since Ambition is a cooperative story-telling game and less a wargame or tactical combat rpg, the players should always be challenged, but not be treated unfairly or confrontational.
    That is not to say, that the players decisions should not have consequences, but more, that there should be warnings and it should be shown, what their characters will get themselves into, if they follow the story.

    <br><br>

    Although their role is special and they have a lot more responsibility during the game, their enjoyment is just as important as that of the players.
    A GM is not a servant of the players and has to bow to their every whim. 
    And although they should usually try to engage the players with a "yes, and..." attitude, sometimes saying "no" can be just as important to keep the game running smoothly.

    <h2>The Players</h2>

    Although the players scope of responsibility is smaller than that of the GM, they are just as important for the development of the story, as they are the ones that create it through their characters actions and the many ways in which they interact with the world during the game.

    <br><br>

    As a player your job is it to role-play your character, to fill them with life and to make decisions as they would do.
    Try to always drive the story forward by being open to new situations and offering ideas.
    As their main objective, the players should also work closely with the GM to create a thrilling and fast-paced story, engage with the world the GM is presenting and work together to overcome obstacles and challenges as their characters.

    <br><br>

    Although the characters do not necessarily need to trust or even like each other, the players should always keep in mind, that Ambition is a team game at its core and they should find ways for their characters to work together.
    The concept of a party, a group of multiple characters is introduced later on in the rules and lines out possible constellations for your characters to work together.

    <br><br>

    In their pursuit of creating a cooperative story, the players should try to keep track of the things that happen during the game, be it names of important NPCs, locations or items, and of course their active quests and story arcs.
    It is up to you, how you want to do this, and as with almost everything Ambition offers, you are not forced to do it in a certain way, as long as you find a way that works for your group, you will be fine!

    <h2>The Party</h2>
    
    An important thing to keep in mind is, that at its core, Ambition is a team game, just like many other ttrpgs and similar games, which means that every player should get involved in the creation of the story and have fun doing so.
    To gather the player characters in a group and maybe even cohesive unit of adventurers, a party should be formed, optimally at the beginning of the story.
    The parties goals should align somewhat, as to make it easier for the GM to engage all players in it during the game on a similar level.
    Additionally this ensures, that all players receive roughly the same amount of attention and chances to be in the spotlight.
    <br><br>
    Usually it is assumed, that the party and all of its members work on quests and problems together.
    Of course there can be some scenes, during which the party splits up and sometime

    <h2>The social Contract</h2>

    <br><br>

    Both GMs and players should always keep in mind, that Ambition is a game, one where you can lose yourself in fantastical worlds and exciting tales, but still one that is fictional.
    So let's try to remember why you all are playing this game, to have fun.

    <br><br>
    
    The main goal of all players should always be to ensure that everyone in the game has fun, this is best achieved by communicating clearly and respectfully, and by nobody abusing their position, either their power as a GM or by exploiting loopholes and rulings as a player.
