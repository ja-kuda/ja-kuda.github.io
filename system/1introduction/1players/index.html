    <h1>The Players</h1>
    Ambition is a roleplaying game that is designed to be played as a group of at least 3 players.
    Players are all those, that participate in the game, one of the players will have to take on a special role, called the Gamemaster, or GM for short.
    
    <h2>The Gamemaster</h2>
    
    The gamemaster, or GM for short, acts as manager and judge of the game and is in charge of everything that is not a player character.
    They keep the world running and make the necessary calls to create tension and dangerous situations for the players characters to thrive in.
    
    A GMs task is to engage the players and control the game, but not necessarily the story, although they are responsible for keeping everything in order and - if necessary - reign in the players to keep the story moving forward.
    
    The GM should always be a fan of the characters and work with - not against - the players during the game.
    Since Ambition is more of a cooperative story-telling engine than a wargame or tactical combat rpg, the players should always be challenged, but not be treated unfairly or confrontational.
    
    Although their role is special and they have special tasks during the game, their enjoyment is just as important as that of the players.
    A GM is not a servant of the players and has to bow to their every whim and although they should usually try to engage the players with a "yes, and..." attitude, but sometimes saying "no" can be just as important to keep the game running smoothly.
    
    <h2>The other Players</h2>
    
    The players on the other hand, create characters and embody them to create the protagonists of the story that is being told during the game.
    They should always try to drive the story forward through their actions and roleplaying.
    
    As their main objective of the players should also work closely with the GM to create a thrilling and fast-paced story, engage with the world the GM is presenting and work together to overcome obstacles and challenges as their characters.
    
    Although the characters do not necessarily need to trust or even like each other, the players should always keep in mind, that Ambition is a team game at its core and they should find ways for their characters to work together.
    
    <h2>The social contract</h2>
    
    Both GMs and players should always keep in mind, that Ambition is a game, one where you can lose yourself in fantastical worlds and exciting tales, but still one that is fictional.
    So let's try to remember why you all are playing this game, to have fun.
    
    The main goal of all players should always be to ensure that everyone in the game has fun, this is best achieved by communicating clearly and respectfully, and by nobody abusing their position, either their power as a GM or by exploiting loopholes and rulings as a player.
