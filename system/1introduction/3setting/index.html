    <h1>The Setting</h1>

    At its core Ambition offers a framework to tell stories, regardless of the surrounding settings.
    It works best in fantasy worlds, especially "The world of Akudia", but you can also easily adapt other fantasy worlds to fit the game, or create your very own.

    <h2>The world of Akudia</h2>

    The world of Akudia is the main setting for a game of Ambition and the rules of the game are deeply interwoven with parts of the world of Akudia.
    Almost all mechanics can be found or explained in and by the lore of the world.
    The ancestries that you can choose from during character creation are implemented and fitted to the setting and nothing stands out.
    Arcane magic, items and other rules, like resurrecting characters are also explained within the world.

    <br><br>

    The world of Akudia can be best explained as the default setting and the easiest way to create a game of Ambition.

    If you want to find out more about the setting, visit TODO, for more information on the world of Akudia as a setting for the game.
    There you will find general information about most of the worlds core concepts, its lore and what makes it different from other fantasy worlds you might know.

    <h2>Creating your own world</h2>

    Ambition can of course be played in a setting that you create yourself.
    Maybe you want to change a few parts from the default setting, maybe you want to add your own lore and explanations for things like magic or monsters, or maybe you want to create your own world from scratch.
    <br>
    Whatever it might be, you can most certainly build an interesting world to fit the games rules.

    <br><br>

    If you want to instead change up the rules to fit your own setting or world, you can take a look at the GM section of the TODO Rules of Ambition, where you will find explanations and tips on how to create your own rules or modify the existing ones, to better fit your game.
