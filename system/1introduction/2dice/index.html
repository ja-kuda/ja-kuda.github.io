    To play the game every player and the GM need - besides a pen and paper - dice.
    
    There are a number of different types or sizes of dice used in this system, they all have in common that they will be referred to by a dX where X is the number of sides on the die.
    
    The most often used dice are these that get used in checks of all sorts are:
    
    \begin{itemize}
        \item d4
        \item d6
        \item d8
    \end{itemize}
    
    When rolling multiple dice of a type the system might say "roll 2d6", this means that the player rolls 2 six-sided dice at the same time and either adds the results together or uses them separately.
    
    Although they are used sparingly, it is not a bad idea to keep some d10s and d12s as well.\\
    
    <h2>Character sheet</h2>
    
    To keep track of your characters, their attributes and stats, abilities and everything you might need to know to play this game, each player creates a character sheet, detailed in chapter 2 - Characters.
    
    This character sheet can be as personalized and customized as you like, it is advised though, that all relevant information is easily and quickly accessible and written in such a form, that you understand even some weeks later, what they mean.
    
    During character creation you will learn the relevant information to put on your character sheet, as well as find an example sheet at the end of the chapter that can be used by simply making a copy and filling it with your newly created character.\\
    
    <h2>Other useful Stuff</h2>
    
    If you keep your character on a physical sheet, a pencil, eraser or erasable markers are surely of good use when it comes to changing information like your characters health or their inventory.
    
    Some way to keep notes of your adventures always comes in handy, especially when playing a longer campaign, as to not forget important events or NPCs.
    
    To keep track of your characters abilities and talents, you can use the talent cards that come with Ambition, they are a fast and easy way to look up all your relevant features.
