    <h1>The Dice</h1>

    \centerline{\includegraphics[width=10cm]{images/dice_2.png}}

    <br><br>

    Ambition is played by using a number of polyhedral dice, which can usually be found in hobby stores or online.
    They will be referred to as dX, where the d stands for dice and the X stands for a number that represents the number of sides on the dice.

    <br><br>

    There a a number of different types of dice used during the game:

    <br><br>

    <ul>
      <li>d4</li>
      <li>d6</li>
      <li>d8</li>
      <li>d10</li>
      <li>d12</li>
    </ul> 

    Any typical rpg dice set should include at least one of each of these dice, most of them even come with a d20, which can come in handy as well, although sparingly.

    <br><br>

    A number coming before the dX counts how many dice are thrown of the given type.
    A notation of 3d6 then means, that you roll 3 six sided dice.
    During playing you will usually roll between 1 and 5 dice, most of them d6, you can do so either one by one, or to speed it up, roll multiple dice at the same time.
    Since the base die for this game is a six sided die, it is advised you stock up on some of them.

    <br><br>

    Although this chapter is called the dice, there are still some small things that can help you during the game:

    <br><br>
    
    <h2>Character Sheet</h2>

    After the players create their characters, they might want to note down their attributes, skills and special abilities.
    To keep track of the characters, a character sheet comes in handy.

    <br><br>

    This character sheet can be as personalized and customized as you like, it is advised though, that all relevant information is easily and quickly accessible and written in such a form, that makes them easily discernible.

    <br><br>

    During character creation you will learn the relevant information to put on your character sheet, as well as find an example sheet at the end of the chapter that can be used by simply making a copy and filling it with your newly created character.

    <br><br>

    <h2>Notes</h2>

    During the game you will find, that taking notes can be vital to remember names, places and quests, as well as your equipment and any changes to your characters.
    For the GM, they might want to note down their plans for a session, names and attributes of NPCs and monsters and maybe even information about the world.

    <br><br>

    Some way to keep notes of your adventures always comes in handy, especially when playing a longer campaign, as to not forget important information.
