    <h1>Wounds</h1>
    A common type of conflict resulting from skirmish checks or other risky actions can be characters taking damage and being injured. 
    Enemies, obstacles, the environment, spell effects or other sources then inflict wounds on them.
    Wounds are accumulated on the character sheet, as indicated by the health section and last until they are treated.
    Each wound also adds flaws x(the wounds level) and affects all checks that use the injured body parts.

    <h2>Gaining Wounds</h2>
    Whenever a player gains a wound on their character sheet they do so by writing down the bodypart that got injured into an empty field of the correct level.
    This serves as a reminder of their characters injuries which have consequences during the game, as well as a measure of their remaining health.
    <br><br>
    If a character gains a wound of a level that is already completely filled, they instead gain a wound of the next highest level that is available.

    <br><br>
    Wounds can have many effects on a character, based on their nature and their location.
    Below you find a general description of wounds of differing levels:
    <br>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Level 1 wounds:</strong> 
        <br>
        Minor injuries that do not restrict a characters abilities all that much, but if they add up, they can become dangerous.
        These wounds include: cuts, bruises, sprained ankles, bent fingers, etc.
        <br>
        Level 1 wounds do not add any disadvantages to a character.
        <br>
        They can be healed by resting, allowing for the characters to remove a lvl 1 wounds.</li>
      <li><strong>Level 2 wounds:</strong> 
        <br>
        Serious injuries that reduce a characters effectiveness notably.
        They include: deep cuts, broken fingers, burns, pierced muscles, broken legs or arms etc.
        <br>
        Level 2 wounds add a flaw based on the injured bodypart. 
        <br>
        Treating lvl 2 wounds during a rest requires 1 resolve and allows to heal it, reducing it to a lvl 1 wound.</li>
      <li><strong>Level 3 wounds:</strong> 
        <br>
        Severe injuries that need to be treated and strongly affect a characters actions.
        These wounds include: deep burns, pierced guts, dismembered hands or legs, etc.
        <br>
        Level 3 wounds restrict actions that use the injured bodypart and can have sever conflict, if not treated.
        <br>
        To heal lvl 3 wounds and reduce them to lvl 2 wounds, a healer needs to be visited, magical powers need to be used or someone in the party needs to have the necessary medical knowledge to treat these wounds.</li>
      <li><strong>Level 4 wounds:</strong> 
        <br>
        This wound is only gained if there are no available free wounds on your character sheet when you gain a wound, or when you take a lvl 4 wound directly through extreme and deadly circumstances, like falling into a volcano or being smashed by a boulder.
        Lvl 4 wounds are not filled, but instead kill the character.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Treating Wounds</h2>
    To get rid of their wounds, characters need to find ways to treat them and eventually heal them.
    This can be done in various ways, the easiest of them being resting, but not all wounds work the same in that regard.
    Healing wounds usually turns them into a wound of a lower lvl, or, in the case of lvl 1 wounds, removes them.
    <br><br>
    <strong>lvl 1 wounds</strong>
    <br>
    The easiest way to heal wounds is resting.
    During a rest, every character can heal a lvl 1 wound, removing it.
    <br><br>
    <strong>lvl 2 wounds</strong>
    <br>
    Almost any wound can be treated by a doctor, physician, in a temple or by dubious surgeons and brewers.
    Alternatively a character can spend 1 resolve to heal a lvl 2 wound during a rest. This replaces the normal healing done during a rest.
    <br><br>
    <strong>lvl 3 wounds</strong>
    <br>
    Level 3 wounds are harder to heal, often requiring either longer downtime, greater amounts of money to pay for surgeons and doctors or having access to arcane or otherwise strong medicine effects.
    This turns them into lvl 2 wounds if possible.
