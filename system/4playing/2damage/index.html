    <h1>Wounds</h1>
    A common type of conflict resulting from skirmish checks or other risky actions can be characters taking damage and being injured. 
    Enemies, obstacles, the environment, spell effects or other sources then inflict wounds on them.
    Wounds are accumulated on the character sheet, as indicated by the health section and last until they are treated.
    Each wound also adds flaws x(the wounds level) and affects all checks that use the injured body parts.

    <h2>Gaining Wounds</h2>
    Whenever a player gains a wound on their character sheet they do so by writing down the wound they suffered into an empty field of the correct level.
    This serves as a reminder of their characters injuries which have consequences during the game, as well as a measure of their remaining health.
    <br><br>
    If a character gains a wound of a level that is already completely filled, they instead gain a wound of the next highest level that is available.

    <br><br>
    Wounds can have many effects on a character, based on their nature and their location.
    Below you find a general description of wounds of differing levels:
    <br>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Level 1 wounds:</strong> 
        <br>
        Minor injuries that do not restrict a characters abilities all that much, but if they add up, they can become dangerous.
        These wounds include: cuts, bruises, sprained ankles, bent fingers, etc.
        <br>
        Level 1 wounds add a temporary flaw based on the injury.
        <br>
        They can be removed by resting, allowing for the characters to heal up to 2 lvl 1 wounds.</li>
      <li><strong>Level 2 wounds:</strong> 
        <br>
        Serious injuries that reduce a characters effectiveness notably.
        They include: deep cuts, broken fingers, burns, pierced muscles, broken legs or arms etc.
        <br>
        Level 2 wounds add 2 temporary flaws based on the affected areas, like holding a sword during skirmish checks with broken fingers or trying to jump with an arrow sticking in your leg.
        <br>
        Treating lvl 2 wounds during a rest requires 1 resolve and allows to reduce it to a lvl 1 wound.</li>
      <li><strong>Level 3 wounds:</strong> 
        <br>
        Severe injuries that need to be treated and strongly affect a characters actions.
        These wounds include: deep burns, pierced guts, dismembered hands or legs, etc.
        <br>
        Level 3 wounds add 3 temporary flaws based on the injury or prevent a character from taking certain actions altogether without serious further risk, meaning that conflict from specific checks is increased.
        <br>
        To heal lvl 3 wounds and reduce them to lvl 2 wounds, a healer needs to be visited, magical powers need to be used or someone in the party needs to have the necessary medical knowledge to treat these wounds.</li>
      <li><strong>Level 4 wounds:</strong> 
        <br>
        This wound is only gained if there are no available free wounds on your character sheet when you gain a wound, or when you take a lvl 4 wound directly through extreme and deadly circumstances, like falling into a volcano or being smashed by a boulder.
        Lvl 4 wounds are not filled, but instead kill the character.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Treating Wounds</h2>
    To get rid of their wounds, characters need to find ways to treat them and eventually heal them.
    This can be done in various ways, the easiest of them being resting, but not all wounds work the same in that regard.
    Healing wounds usually turns them into a wound of a lower lvl, or, in the case of lvl 1 wounds, removes them.
    <br><br>
    <strong>lvl 1 wounds</strong>
    <br>
    The easiest way to heal wounds is resting.
    During a rest, every character can heal two lvl 1 wounds, removing them.
    <br><br>
    <strong>lvl 2 wounds</strong>
    <br>
    Almost any wound can be treated by a doctor, physician, in a temple or by dubious surgeons and brewers.
    Alternatively a character can spend 1 resolve to heal a lvl 2 wound during a rest. This counts as them healing wounds and thus they can not also heal the usual two lvl 1 wounds.
    <br><br>
    <strong>lvl 3 wounds</strong>
    <br>
    Level 3 wounds are harder to get heal, often requiring either longer downtime, greater amounts of money to pay for surgeons and doctors or having access to arcane or otherwise strong medicine effects.
    This turns them into lvl 2 wounds if possible.

    <h2>Preventing Wounds</h2>
    
    There are of course ways for characters to prevent gaining wounds altogether, either by blocking it with armor or shields, or by reducing incoming damage through the use of talents, spells or items.
    <br><br>
    <strong>Armor</strong>
    <br>
    Armor is a great tool to keep your characters from accumulating wounds.
    Every time armor is referenced in these rules, it comes with an armor value, a number that functions as the opposite of the damage number the GM uses to inflict wounds.
    <br><br>
    Each time a character would take a wound while they have at least 1 armor value, they reduce the wound by their remaining armor value and their armor takes the damage instead.
    Once an armors armor value reaches 0, the item is destroyed or damaged, so that it must be repaired or replaced.
    <br><br>
    <span style="color: #6f8dbd"><i>A platemail armor that has an armor value of 3 can reduce the level of wounds 3 times in any combination.</i></span>
    <br><br>
    For more information on armor items and their uses and specifics, have a look at chapter TODO.
    <br><br>
    <strong>Resistances</strong>
    <br>
    Far less common than armor, but all the more powerful are the different resistances.
    They target certain wound types like fire, poison or even arcane and serve as a static reduction of wounds of that type.
    <br><br>
    Resistances reduce the level of incoming wounds of a certain type or element by 1.
    <br><br>
    <span style="color: #6f8dbd"><i>A character is resistant against fire and is hit by a fiery explosion, gaining a lvl 2 wound by getting burned badly on their arms. This wound is reduced to lvl 1, as they maybe only burn some of their hair and skin.</i></span>
