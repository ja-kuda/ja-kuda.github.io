    \section{Crafting}
\label{sec:crafting}

Becoming self sufficient and not reliant on merchants for their equipment can be the dream of many characters, be it smiths that create and upgrade their armor and weapons, cooks that create food and drink, or alchemists that create crazy and dangerous bombs, tinctures or potions.

Whatever it may be, that your characters want to create themselves, they most certainly have the ability to do so by crafting.

Every character can use their crafting skill to try their hand at repairs and small adjustments of existing items and inventions.
Crafting checks also can be made as a way to determine the outcome of tinkering and experimenting with mechanical and natural devices.

Typical conflict for crafting checks could be an increase in cost, longer building times or defective and unstable creations.

More complex creations and modifications require the necessary tools, ingredients and most importantly knowledge.
By learning talents that focus on certain aspects of crafting, like smithing, brewing or alchemy, characters can gain access to special abilities tied to crafting, as well as the ability to read and understand certain crafting recipes, the basis of most inventions.

Without crafting recipes, the crafting process becomes harder and more resource intensive, but not impossible.
Characters that want to focus on crafting, should however consider learning a t least a few crafting related talents during the game.

\subsection{Crafting recipes}
The creation of more complex and detailed items and trinkets is harder, but not impossible for the characters to learn.
They can make use of so called recipes, crafting instructions they can learn, which allows them to create items and other inventions with a single crafting check.

To understand recipes of a certain type, a character needs to be specialized in that form of crafting by learning its respective talent:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Alchemy formulas} Creations made from chemical substances and elements. To learn and use these recipes, a character needs the Alchemist talent.
    \item \textbf{Brewer recipes} Food, drink and potions, as well as poisons. To learn and use these recipes, a character needs the Brewer talent.
    \item \textbf{Mutation genecasts} Biological creations that change ones body. To learn and use these recipes, a character needs the Mutationist talent.
    \item \textbf{Inventor blueprints} Gadgets, tools and other mechanical items. To learn and use these recipes, a character needs the Inventor talent.
    \item \textbf{Battlesmith prototypes} Machines and weapons of technological advance. To learn and use these recipes, a character needs the Battlesmith talent.
\end{itemize}

Every recipe usually includes the following information:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Name} 
    \item \textbf{Type} 
    \item \textbf{Ingredients} 
    \item \textbf{Special ingredients} 
    \item \textbf{Result} 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Inventing}
TODO?: Evtl. raus?
Characters can of course try their hand at inventing their own recipes.
A specialized character can choose to begin experimentation and research and later on the process of creating a wholly new item or gadget.

Characters that want to invent a crafting recipe on their own, can do so by following the three basic steps below:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Research} 
    \item \textbf{Experimentation} 
    \item \textbf{Prototyping} 
\end{itemize}

Each of these steps takes a number of ingredients determined by the GM, based on the complexity and scope of the characters invention.
The character then makes a crafting check for the current stage of inventing, gaining boons or flaws based on their laboratories and other factors, such as concentration, urgency or danger and need to beat a set number, based on the complexity.
The number is the stage of inventing + the number of ingredients needed for the stage of inventing.

Only after a stage is completed successfully, can the character begin with the next one.
How long it takes to complete a stage is also based on the complexity of the invention.
After successfully finishing the third stage, the character learns the invention as a crafting recipe and gains a prototype version of their creation.

Since all ideas for inventions have to go by the GM, they can choose which scientific advancements and ideas to allow in the game, for example, letting a character create an atomic bomb with these rules might not be an invention fitting in every campaign and can thus be vetoed by the GM.

\subsection{Ingredients}
\label{sec:ingredients}
In their most basic form, ingredients are all those parts, tools and items used when crafting, such as nails, wood planks, distilled water, black powder, nitre, root sap, glass shards, leather straps, blood etc.

Buying, creating, gathering or otherwise acquiring ingredients, assumes that the character in question always tries to stock up on all the things they need for all of their learned recipes and for their repairs etc.
As such, crafting ingredients are tracked on your character sheets as a simple number, indicating how many resources your character has on them.

Ingredients can be spend in two similar ways, either by using them to increase a crafting check by spending ingredients and gaining a boon for each ingredient spent, or by paying the costs for the creation of an item from a crafting recipe.

Since the main goal of the game is to keep the story moving forward, more complex systems for crafting are omitted and instead rely on the players creativity and role-play to fill them with life.


\subsection{Special ingredients}

Special ingredients encompass all named ingredients used in recipes.
Creating a poison that only harms dragons for example might need a special ingredient relating to dragons or their weakness, an arcane revolver could need tangible magical energy as special ingredient.

Special ingredients are always named in the respective recipes and acquiring them can be a great opportunity for small side quests and plot hooks.

Special ingredients are real and tangible items in the story, and as such can be tracked in the inventory of your character sheet.
