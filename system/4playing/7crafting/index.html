    <h1>Crafting</h1>
    Becoming self sufficient and not reliant on merchants for their equipment can be the dream of many characters, be it smiths that create and upgrade their armor and weapons, cooks that create food and drink, or alchemists that create crazy and dangerous bombs, tinctures or potions.
    Whatever it may be, that your characters want to create themselves, they most certainly have the ability to do so by crafting.
    <br><br>
    Every character can use their crafting skill to try their hand at repairs and small adjustments of existing items and inventions.
    Crafting checks also can be made as a way to determine the outcome of tinkering and experimenting with mechanical and natural devices.
    <br>
    Typical conflict for crafting checks could be an increase in cost, longer building times or defective and unstable creations.
    <br><br>
    More complex creations and modifications require the necessary tools, ingredients and most importantly knowledge.
    By learning talents that focus on certain aspects of crafting, like smithing, brewing or alchemy, characters can gain access to special abilities tied to crafting, as well as the ability to read and understand certain crafting recipes, the basis of most inventions.

    <h2>How to craft</h2>

    To create an item, a consumable or a modification to an existing item, you first need to visualize your creation.
    Similar to the arcane, the scientific arts are mostly limitless and only restricted by your imagination and mabye some laws of physics (or maybe not, depending how far you are willing to push your craft).
    <br><br>
    If you want to craft something from scratch and without instructions, follow these steps:
    <br>
    <ol>
      <li>First, think of an item you want to craft. Do you want to create something completely new or modify an existing item or recipe? Explain what you want to craft to the GM.</li>
      <li>Determine if your character has the necessary knowledge and tools for the job. Many crafting talents allow you to add new forms of crafting to your character.</li>
      <li>The GM determines the cost of crafting the item or the experiment. You always need to provide the materials and sometimes special ingredients as well. You can also freely add any ingredients you want to the crafting process, modifying the outcome.</li>
      <li>Make a crafting check to determine the outcome of your crafting: 
        <br>
        <span style="color: #9bbb59"><strong>You successfully craft your idea and also gain a recipe for your creation</span>
        <br>
        <span style="color: #c19c0b">You create your idea</span>
        <br>
        <span style="color: #ba372a">You create your idea, but the resulting item has a flaw or works not fully as you intended</strong></span></li>
    </ol>
     Many types of items require special crafting talents, before they can be invented and refined.
    <br>
    By describing your creation to the GM, you can both work out any prerequisites and costs for the item. Crafting an item takes time, smaller inventions might only take a few minutes, other, larger projects might take the whole day to complete.
    <br>

    <h2>Materials</h2>

    In their most basic form, crafting materials are all those parts, tools and items used when crafting, such as nails, wood planks, distilled water, black powder, nitre, root sap, glass shards, leather straps, blood etc.
    <br>
    Buying, creating, gathering or otherwise acquiring materials, assumes that the character in question always tries to stock up on all the things they need for all of their learned recipes and for their repairs etc.
    As such, crafting materials are tracked on your character sheets as a simple number, indicating how many resources your character has on them.
    <br>
    Since the main goal of the game is to keep the story moving forward, more complex systems for crafting are omitted and instead rely on the players creativity and role-play to fill them with life.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    During your travels and adventurers you will stumble upon special ingredients and wells of knowledge that you can use to improve your crafting immensely.
    <br>
    These ingredients can be harvested from a variety of sources, analyzing animals, plants or monsters being the most common, but they can also be bought or traded from others or found as rewards or treasure.
    Using a laboratory or research can also lead to interesting discoveries in your respective fields of knowledge and sometimes yield ingredients.
    <br><br>
    Many of your own creations and crafting recipes will require one or more ingredients before they can be crafted and they are used up in the crafting process.
    They can also be used to modify recipes and crafting in general.

    <h2>Recipes</h2>

    Many crafters and alchemists tend to note down their scientific findings and how to create their inventions.
    These crafting instructions are called recipes and can be found all over.
    <br>
    Recipes still require materials and ingredients, but they in turn usually allow the user to skip the crafting check, making them akin to nonmagic static spells.
    <br>
    Some recipes however still need the character to make a crafting check, this is reserved for especially powerful and complex creations.
    The results of this crafting check determine the quality and possible side effects of the crafting process.
    <br><br>
    There are a number of different types of crafting recipes, like alchemy formulas, brewing recipes, mutation genecasts and inventor blueprints.
    A character needs to be specialized in a certain type of crafting to be able to understand its respective crafting recipes.
    <br><br>
    Crafting recipes are structured as follows:

    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Name} 
        \item \textbf{Type}
        \item \textbf{Ingredients}
        \item \textbf{Discoveries} 
        \item \textbf{Result}
    \end{itemize}
