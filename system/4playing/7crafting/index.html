    <h1>Crafting</h1>
    Becoming self sufficient and not reliant on merchants for their equipment can be the dream of many characters, be it smiths that create and upgrade their armor and weapons, cooks that create food and drink, or alchemists that create crazy and dangerous bombs, tinctures or potions.
    Whatever it may be, that your characters want to create themselves, they most certainly have the ability to do so by crafting.
    <br><br>
    Every character can use their crafting skill to try their hand at repairs and small adjustments of existing items and inventions.
    Crafting checks also can be made as a way to determine the outcome of tinkering and experimenting with mechanical and natural devices.
    <br>
    Typical conflict for crafting checks could be an increase in cost, longer building times or defective and unstable creations.
    <br><br>
    More complex creations and modifications require the necessary tools, ingredients and most importantly knowledge.
    By learning talents that focus on certain aspects of crafting, like smithing, brewing or genetics, characters can gain access to special abilities tied to crafting, as well as the ability to read and understand certain crafting recipes, the basis of most inventions.

    <h2>How to craft</h2>

    To create an item, a consumable or a modification to an existing item, you first need to visualize your creation.
    Similar to the arcane, the scientific arts are mostly limitless and only restricted by your imagination and mabye some laws of physics (or maybe not, depending how far you are willing to push your craft).
    <br><br>
    Wether you want to craft something from scratch or by using instructions, follow these steps:
    <br>
    <ol>
      <li>Choose wether to use an existing recipe or craft freely. If you want to create something new, explain what you want to craft to the GM.</li>
      <li>The GM determines the cost of crafting and the difficulty of the item or the experiment. You always need to provide the materials and can use special ingredients as well.</li>
      <li>Make a crafting check to determine the outcome of your crafting. Based on your checks result, your creation can range from fully functional to dangerously unstable.</li>
    </ol>
    <br>
    By describing your creation to the GM, you can both work out any prerequisites and costs for the item. Crafting an item takes time, smaller inventions might only take a few minutes, other, larger projects might take the whole day to complete.

    <h2>Materials</h2>

    In their most basic form, crafting materials are all those parts, tools and items used when crafting, such as nails, wood planks, distilled water, black powder, nitre, root sap, glass shards, leather straps, blood etc.
    <br><br>
    Buying, creating, gathering or otherwise acquiring materials, assumes that the character in question always tries to stock up on all the things they need for all of their learned recipes and for their repairs etc.
    As such, crafting materials are tracked on your character sheets as a simple number, indicating how many resources your character has on them.
    <br><br>
    Crafting materials are used as costs in every crafting check and are always destroyed, regardless of the checks result.
    <br><br>
    Since the main goal of the game is to keep the story moving forward, more complex systems for crafting are omitted and instead rely on the players creativity and role-play to fill them with life.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    During your travels and adventurers you will stumble upon special ingredients and wells of knowledge that you can use to improve your crafting immensely.
    <br>
    These ingredients can be harvested from a variety of sources, analyzing animals, plants or monsters being the most common, but they can also be bought or traded from others or found as rewards or treasure.
    Using a laboratory or research can also lead to interesting discoveries in your respective fields of knowledge and sometimes yield ingredients.
    <br><br>
    Many of your own creations and crafting recipes will require one or more ingredients before they can be crafted and they are used up in the crafting process.
    They can also be used to modify recipes and crafting in general.
    <br><br>
    Crafting ingredients add a bonus to the crafting check(s) they are used in if their type and characteristics match your creation.
    Unlike materials, they are only destroyed in a successful crafting check or if certain conditions apply.

    <h2>Recipes</h2>

    Many crafters and alchemists tend to note down their scientific findings and how to create their inventions.
    These crafting instructions are called recipes and can be found all over.
    They allow for anybody with a little bit of crafting expertise to create its respective item(s), even if they come from a different specialization.
    <br>
    This means, that a Brewer can create a birds-eye mutation if they buy a recipe of that item.
    <br><br>
    Recipes still require materials and ingredients and a crafting check, making them akin to nonmagic static spells.
    <br>
    There are a number of different types of crafting recipes, like alchemy formulas, brewing recipes, mutation genecasts and inventor blueprints.
    <br><br>
    Crafting recipes are structured as follows:

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Name</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Type</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Materials</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Ingredients</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Result</strong></li>
    </ul>
