    <h1>Resting</h1>
    After a stressful and exhausting day of adventuring, the characters might have to regain some of their resources and treat their wounds.
    <br><br>
    They can choose to take a rest, usually a nights worth of sleep, to relax a bit and review the day.
    During this time they sleep, eat and make themselves comfortable to gain access to different forms of regeneration.
    The characters can also talk and interact with each other to strengthen their bonds and relationships. (A rest is of course not the only time they can do so, but it is always available.)
    <br><br>
    Sleeping in the cold wilderness during a rainstorm is not as comfortable as spending the night in an inn's bed.
    This comfort modifies the quality of any given rest and can increase or decrease the various options the characters have to regenerate their resources.
    Maybe a rest inside of a shallow pool of water or outside during cold temperatures even exhausts the characters instead.
    <br><br>
    The following resources are restored during a rest:
    <br><br>
    <strong>Talent charges</strong>
    <br>
    During a rest a character regains all uses of their talents up to the talents max charges if not otherwise specified.
    <br><br>
    <strong>Wounds</strong>
    <br>
    During a rest a character can heal one lvl 1 wound and remove it.
    <br><br>
    <strong>Arcane threads</strong>
    <br>
    During a rest a character recovers all of their arcane threads.
    <br><br>
    <strong>Fatigue and Stress</strong>
    <br>
    During a rest traits like fatigue and stress are automatically removed, if there are no other circumstances preventing this.

    <h2>Downtime</h2>
    TODO:
    <br><br>
    Not always is simply resting for a night a viable option for the characters to revitalize, or sometimes they decide to take a time out from their adventures to focus on personal projects, restock or simply spend a few days in peace and quiet.
    <br><br>
    Longer rests - or downtime - allow for the characters to fully regenerate and even pursue more time intensive things like crafting a large construction, learning new skills or run a tavern.
    Downtime can also be used as a tool to let the characters reconnect with NPCs they met during their travels and maybe even make some money by working a less dangerous job for a time.
    <br><br>
    In theory the characters can choose to spend some downtime whenever they want, to fully regain all of their resources and make meaningful progress in the activities above, each downtime should encompass at least 5 days or more of time and the GM should try and limit how often downtime is possible without consequences, as to not grind down the game and the story to a halt.
    <br><br>
    As to not slow down the game with many downtime activities, consider running them as a kind of montage.
    The GM asks what each players wants to achieve during the timeframe and makes all necessary checks in a row.
    Shopping, repairing items or keeping up with other expenses can be done this way too.
