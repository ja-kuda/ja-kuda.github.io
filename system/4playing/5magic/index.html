    <h1>The Arcane</h1>
    
    Every being is connected to the fabric of reality in one way or another.
    And while most of them will never have a deeper connection to it, there are some that develop fantastical and supernatural abilities when pursuing their ambitions with zealous fervor.
    By approaching their ascension, they can become arcanes, magically infused beings that manipulate the very energies that make up reality.
    <br><br>
    Their abilities can grow greatly and they can become more powerful by gaining more knowledge of the arcane.
    Arcanes are somewhat restricted by their control over certain elements, making them specialists in areas, such as fire, water, mind, or even time itself.
    Since wielding arcane magic means to control and change reality itself, it also means that arcanes must be careful to keep control as to not damage or destroy the fabric of reality.
    <br><br>
    All characters can gain access to arcane threads the fuel to cast spells and weave arcane effects by increasing their arcane skill.
    Those that want to specialize in certain forms of arcane magic can do so by choosing arcane talents during character creation or when leveling up.

    <div class="trenn"><img class="trennLine" src="images/line_10.PNG" alt="trenn"/></div>

    <h2>Casting arcane Spells</h2>
    
    The basic process for arcanes to create magical effects is the following, the keywords will be described in more detail below:
    <br><br>
    <ol>
      <li>Choose an <strong>arcane form</strong> and an <strong>arcane element</strong> you learned to combine them into a magical effect.</li>
      <li>Spend between 0 and 5 <strong>arcane threads</strong> to increase the spells <strong>intensity</strong>.</li>
      <li>Roll an arcane check to <strong>control</strong> the spell and determine conflict from manipulating the fabric of reality.</li>
      <li>The spells effect and possible conflict is resolved.</li>
    </ol>

    <div class="trenn"><img class="trennLine" src="images/line_12.PNG" alt="trenn"/></div>
    
    <h2>Arcane Form</h2>
    
    Arcane forms are the most basic ways in which an arcane wrestles control over the elements from the fabric of reality.
    When casting a spell, the forms give shape to the chosen element and create the spells effect.
    <br><br>
    There are 5 basic forms that can be learned separately as talents:
    <br><br>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Creation</strong><br>creating an element from thin air or creating something out of it.</li>
      <li><strong>Destruction</strong><br>destroying an element or using an element to harm or destroy others.</li>
      <li><strong>Exploration</strong><br>learning about and from an element, as well as perceiving and learning with it.</li>
      <li><strong>Control</strong><br>controlling and moving an element, giving it form and using it to interact with the world.</li>
      <li><strong>Mutation</strong><br>changing and manipulating an element, giving it new forms or properties.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <br><br>
    
    Many effects can be achieved by using different forms, the more creative an arcane wields their spells, the more options are open to them.
    Forms can also be combined to achieve even more powerful effects, such as summoning a flame with the creation form and then using it to blow up a bandits hideout with the destruction form.
    <br><br>
    Each arcane element has one form that represents its thesis and one that represents its antithesis.
    This allows for the caster to gain an additional arcane thread worth of intensity for free whenever they cast a spell of an element and its favourable form.
    On the other hand they also lose a thread worth of intensity when creating a spell effect that uses the elements inappropriate form.

    <div class="trenn"><img class="trennLine" src="images/line_9.PNG" alt="trenn"/></div>
     
    <h2>Arcane Elements</h2>
    
    The arcane elements make up the fabric of reality and determine how and in what ways an arcane can use them to manipulate the world around them.
    To wield an arcane element means to control a part of reality itself.
    <br><br>
    In unison with arcane forms they are used to create arcane spell effects and serve as the medium, while the form serves as the action of the effect.
    <br><br>
    A character can learn to use multiple elements, though it must be noted, that focusing on more than one arcane elements becomes harder and harder, as there are only a handful of individuals that can withstand the added pressure of keeping them under control.

    <div class="trenn"><img class="trennLine" src="images/elements/fire_3.PNG" alt="trenn"/></div>
    
    <h3>Fire</h3>
    The element of fire is that of volatility and destruction, but also that of emotion.
    Its effects seem to have a will of its own and once lit, a fire becomes a living and breathing creature that will follow its own path, if not restricted and controlled.
    <br>
    Arcanes that control fire quickly learn what it takes to dominate this element, let they perish within the flames of their own creation.
    This process is a hard journey, one that inevitable brings pain and suffering, but also power and admiration.
    <br>
    Once mastered, the element of fire becomes a nigh unparalleled force and allows the users to control and create flames, heatwaves, magma and even explosions.
    The fire element mostly deals fire damage.
    <br><br>
    Fires preferred form is destruction.
    <br>
    Fires rejected form is control.
    <br><br>
    Below are some examples of fire effects:
    <br><br>
    <ul>
      <li>Envelop yourself or others in flames</li>
      <li>Heat up an item or an area</li>
      <li>Set something ablaze and burn it</li>
      <li>Shoot a fireball out of your hands</li>
      <li>Create an explosion, centered on a point</li>
      <li>Make it rain fire from the sky</li>
      <li>Create a smoke cloud</li>
      <li>Control the flow of magma</li>
    </ul>
    
    <div class="trenn"><img class="trennLine" src="images/elements/water_3.PNG" alt="trenn"/></div>
    
    <h3>Water</h3>
    The element of water is that of tranquility and purity.
    However this does not mean, that water cannot be as dangerous as some of the other elements.
    <br>
    Arcanes that control this element are able to create water from moisture in the air, freeze it to create ice structures or weapons and move it with ease.
    Experienced users may be able to create misty clouds that envelop massive areas or even try to control the water inside of living creatures.
    <br>
    The water element usually deals ice damage.
    <br><br>
    Waters preferred form is mutation.
    <br>
    Waters rejected form is destruction.
    <br><br>
    Below are some examples of water effects:
    <br><br>
    <ul>
      <li>Heat or cool watermasses</li>
      <li>Let it rain in an area</li>
      <li>Control a mass of water</li>
      <li>Create a mist or fog cloud and control it</li>
      <li>Use waterjets to propel yourself</li>
      <li>Shoot icicles or water blasts</li>
      <li>Create a structure from ice</li>
      <li>Create water out of the moisture in the air</li>
      <li>Freeze a creature solid</li>
      <li>Control a living creature by moving the water in its body</li>
      <li>Create water inside of a creatures lungs</li>
    </ul>
    
    <div class="trenn"><img class="trennLine" src="images/elements/air_3.PNG" alt="trenn"/></div>
    
    <h3>Air</h3>
    The air element is that of spirituality and freedom, but also that of storm and lightning, making it extremely versatile in most regions and locations.
    <br>
    Arcane that control the air element can choose to tread a peaceful path, using their powers to control and manipulate the world around them by using the air and gusts of wind, clouds and levitation abilities, or they can choose violence and make use of the sinister applications of this element.
    Creating storms, shooting lightning from their fingertips, or even drawing the breath from the lungs of their enemies are all well within their reach.
    <br>
    The element is available almost everywhere and mostly invisible, making the learning process hard, but worth it, mastering this element opens up more options than most others for the arcane that tries their hand at it.
    <br>
    The air element deals mostly electric damage.
    <br><br>
    Airs preferred form is control.
    <br>
    Airs rejected form is creation.
    <br><br>
    Below are some examples of air effects:
    <br><br>
    <ul>
      <li>Shoot air blasts</li>
      <li>Create a vacuum around a creature</li>
      <li>Summon winds or storms</li>
      <li>Use the air around you to fly</li>
      <li>Summon lightning from your hands or the sky</li>
      <li>Breath everywhere</li>
      <li>Pull the breath out of a creatures lungs</li>
      <li>Infuse yourself or items with electricity</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="trenn"><img class="trennLine" src="images/elements/earth_3.PNG" alt="trenn"/></div>
    
    <h3>Earth</h3>
    The earth element is one of certainty, stagnation and unyielding.
    To control the earth element means to control one self, especially in body.
    Inexperienced arcanes that control this element can easily fall victim to their own spells, getting buried by tons of earth and mud or shattered to pieces by their own earthquakes.
    <br>
    Ton control the earth means to control the ground you walk on, be it dirt, mud, sand, stone or even minerals and metals, most everything that once came from the earth itself will be subject to your will.
    <br>
    Arcanes that master this element gain the ability to raise monuments and structures from seemingly thin air, just as easy as creating, they can destroy solid ground and summon sinkholes, earthquakes or avalanches, putting them on par with the fire element for being one of the most destructive elements to wield.
    Mastering this element also allows for the manipulation of not only earth, but also metals and crystal, allowing for more flexible uses of these powers.
    <br>
    The earth element deals primarily normal damage by bludgeoning or piercing their targets with sharp stones or heavy rocks.
    <br><br>
    Earths preferred form is creation.
    <br>
    Earths rejected form is mutation.
    <br><br>
    Below are some examples of earth effects:
    <br><br>
    <ul>
      <li>Quickly dig a tunnel in earth or stone</li>
      <li>Easily lift and carry masses of earth or rock</li>
      <li>Cover your body in an armor made of stone</li>
      <li>Harden or soften the ground</li>
      <li>Create platforms, walls or other structures</li>
      <li>Trigger an avalanche</li>
      <li>Shake the earth</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="trenn"><img class="trennLine" src="images/elements/essence_3.PNG" alt="trenn"/></div>
    
    <h3>Essence</h3>
    To control the element of essence means to control life itself, at least partially.
    The element of essence is that of life and symbiosis, concerning itself with animals, plants and nature itself.
    To control a creatures body or allowing vegetation to bloom are just some of the effects that are open to arcanes that control this element.
    <br>
    Though not every aspect of life can be controlled by this element, especially the manipulation of life energy itself and thus the creation or corruption of life are beyond the scopes of this element.
    Healing, mending and also damaging living organisms however is easily achieved and one of the certain strengths of this element.
    <br>
    Master of essence are able to manipulate themselves and others to such a degree, that they can even change their form, control small armies of rabid animals or use plants and spores to quickly overgrow a whole city block.
    <br>
    The most common damage type of essence is poison.
    <br><br>
    Essences preferred form is mutation.
    <br>
    Essences rejected form is creation.
    <br><br>
    Below are some examples of essence effects:
    <br><br>
    <ul>
      <li>Talk with plants or animals</li>
      <li>Use vines to restrict others</li>
      <li>Shoot hard thorns out of your fingertips</li>
      <li>Remove a poisons effects</li>
      <li>Mutate your own body or that of another creature</li>
      <li>Control an animal or other simple creature</li>
      <li>Shapeshift into plants or creatures</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="trenn"><img class="trennLine" src="images/elements/mind_3.PNG" alt="trenn"/></div>
    
    <h3>Mind</h3>
    As easily as many of the arcane elements can destroy life and damage bystanders, none other can destroy the lives of people without even hurting them as easily as the element of mind.
    The mind element is that of curiosity and knowledge, but also control and manipulation.
    <br>
    To use this element against intelligent creatures is an affront, revealing most intimate secrets and forever seeding doubt into the minds of those that are affected by it, often destroying their trustworthiness in themselves and others forever.
    <br>
    Arcanes that control this element are able to read minds and manipulate their targets, hypnotizing them or even outright taking control of them through their thoughts.
    Masters can not only change memories, they can create entirely new ones, as well as pulling on the heartstrings and most primal fears of their prey, making them especially dangerous in political and social settings, often requiring kings and other powerful rulers to employ a mind mage as their most trusted advisors.
    <br>
    The mind element does deal damage directly most of the time, instead its destructive properties are a result of the actions of the affected creatures.
    <br><br>
    Minds preferred form is exploration.
    <br>
    Minds rejected form is destruction.
    <br><br>
    Below are some examples of mind effects:
    <br><br>
    <ul>
      <li>Communicate telepathically with another person</li>
      <li>Read the mind of a creature</li>
      <li>Change memories of a creature</li>
      <li>Invoke emotions like fear, love or hate</li>
      <li>Hypnotize a creature stun it</li>
      <li>Control the mind of a creature</li>
      <li>Create illusions</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="trenn"><img class="trennLine" src="images/elements/light_3.PNG" alt="trenn"/></div>
    
    <h3>Light</h3>
    The element of light is often referred to as the divine element, granting arcanes that control it, godly powers and blessings.
    That may be partially true, but the true purpose of the light element is that of balance and the control of light, as well as dark.
    <br>
    Light arcanes control light - using it to see, blind or even bestow their allies with holy blessings - just as they control the absence of light, creating shadows, becoming invisible or pulling creatures into the dark.
    <br>
    Their effects might seem weak, compared to other arcane elements, but masters of this element can push it to its limits by drawing upon the godlike powers that lie within it, creating areas of absolute darkness or light, bending the light to their will and even use their divine properties, like magically healing or harming others.
    <br>
    The light element is special in that it rarely deals damage directly, but when it is used to hurt, the damage is absolute.
    <br><br>
    Lights preferred form is mutation.
    <br>
    Lights rejected form is exploration.
    <br><br>
    Below are some examples of light effects:
    <br><br>
    <ul>
      <li>Create a magical light source</li>
      <li>Manipulate shadows to hide in them</li>
      <li>Bend light around a point to create an area of invisibility</li>
      <li>Blind a creature with intense light</li>
      <li>Plunge a creature into darkness and trap it within shadows</li>
      <li>Create a small sun or moon in your hand</li>
      <li>Inspire hope and courage by shining a hopeful light on your followers</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="trenn"><img class="trennLine" src="images/elements/space_3.PNG" alt="trenn"/></div>
    
    <h3>Space</h3>
    The element of space is that of creation and creativity, allowing arcanes to manipulate and alter reality to their will.
    The element controls the basic structure of reality, making what once was unattainable because of distance, weight or size, now subject to ones whim.
    Arcanes that control this element can teleport, manipulate the space around them to travel long distances in the blink of an eye.
    They also gain the ability to change attributes of almost anything around them, making heavy light and large small, or vice versa.
    <br>
    Masters create teleportation circles, allowing them to access certain locations in a heartbeat, change the properties of water to become solid or even remove structures from the face of the earth.
    <br>
    Space arcanes however have to be careful, even more so then their brethren of the other elements, to not get carried away by their immense power, altering the space around them and reality itself can have dire consequences and if not checked, maybe even destroy all of Akudia.
    <br>
    The space element, like some others does not deal direct damage most of the time, instead relying on the creativity of the user to harm others and letting gravity or physics take care of it.
    <br><br>
    Spaces preferred form is control.
    <br>
    Spaces rejected form is creation.
    <br><br>
    Below are some examples of space effects:
    <br><br>
    <ul>
      <li>Teleport yourself a short distance</li>
      <li>Open up two portals that are connected and can be traveled between</li>
      <li>Alter the layout of a room by bending space</li>
      <li>Look at a far away place or creature</li>
      <li>Rip a creature in half by teleporting parts of it in different locations</li>
      <li>Create a subspace in reality</li>
      <li>Move items or creatures telepathically</li>
    </ul>
    
    <div class="trenn"><img class="trennLine" src="images/elements/time_3.PNG" alt="trenn"/></div>
    
    <h3>Time</h3>
    Time, the last of the arcane elements, or is it the first?
    It is one of uncertainty and flow, allowing arcanes to literally control time itself.
    <br>
    Slowing or quickening creatures and movement, freezing things in time or even traveling in the past or future are all possibilities, opened up by the control of this element.
    <br>
    Masters of the time element can even freeze time for a whole area or create time loops and alternative timelines.
    But just like the element of space, time is a fickle mistress and if control is ever lost, the consequences could be devastating.
    <br>
    The time element, as like many others, deals no direct elemental damage but instead relies on the caster and their use of the element to harm others with its effects.
    <br><br>
    Times preferred form is exploration.
    <br>
    Times rejected form is destruction.
    <br><br>
    Below are some examples of time effects:
    <br><br>
    <ul>
      <li>Slow down a creature</li>
      <li>Travel back or forth in time</li>
      <li>Rapidly age something</li>
      <li>Look into the past or the future</li>
      <li>Trap a creature in a timeloop</li>
      <li>Stop time</li>
      <li>Reverse time</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="trenn"><img class="trennLine" src="images/elements/life_3.PNG" alt="trenn"/></div>
    
    <h3>Life</h3>
    Besides the already listed arcane elements there is another form, a much younger and less researched type of magic, the manipulation of life energy itself.
    Each creature contains a certain amount of life energy or soul, which is contained in their mortal form until they die, which leads to their soul passing through Limbo into the afterlife.
    The steady creation and ending of life lead to a balance in the forces of life energy until the veil, the barrier between life and death, was damaged and almost destroyed by a curious and malicious god called Visaron.
    He opened a way for mortals to work magical effects that manipulate life energy itself, pulling it from souls or living creatures alike.
    This type of magic became known as Nekromancy, and is mostly forbidden, as it may have some good and noble uses, but too high of a price.
    <br>
    Arcanes that use this element are able to control life, heal wounds or speak to and guide souls.
    But they are also able to do the opposites, destroy life energy, create and control undead and even manipulate and steal away souls.
    <br>
    Masters of this element are rare and only few of them were not purged from history, but those that are still remembered, were truly terrifying and dangerous masters of life and death.
    <br><br>
    Lifes preferred form is creation.
    <br>
    Lifes rejected form is mutation.
    <br><br>
    Below are some examples of life effects:
    <br><br>
    <ul>
      <li>Sap away a creatures life energy and gain it for yourself</li>
      <li>Heal a creatures wounds magically</li>
      <li>Raise undead from a corpse or bones</li>
      <li>Speak with the dead or with ghosts</li>
      <li>Use nekromantic energy to destroy a creatures body</li>
      <li>Revive a person that has died recently</li>
    </ul>
    
    <div class="trenn"><img class="trennLine" src="images/line_8.PNG" alt="trenn"/></div>
    
    <h2>Arcane Threads</h2>
    
    Arcane threads represent the magical reserves and energy a character possesses and can be spend to fuel the casting of a spell.
    You gain arcane threads based on your arcane skill. (per point in the skill you gain 3 arcane threads)
    This means, that not only those that choose to learn arcane spellcasting, but every being has the potential to use the threads in some way or another.
    <br><br>
    It is clearly visible when a spell is cast or woven, as the Arcane draws threads, fragments of the arcane weave, from their vicinity and manifests them into tangible magic.
    Every time an arcane user draws arcane threads, they must channel them through their own body and if they are not careful and overestimate themselves these energies can cause side effects - sometimes weird, sometimes dangerous, sometimes deadly.
    <br><br>
    Spells of an intensity higher than 0 require the caster to spend a number of arcane threads equal to the spells intensity to be cast successfully.
    <br><br>
    Once a character draws any number of threads, they become unavailable until they rest during which they regain half of their maximum back.
    There are some ways to regain arcane threads, such as gaining them through life energy with nekromancy or praying to an ascended for power, but they are generally locked behind certain arcane talents.
    
    <div class="trenn"><img class="trennLine" src="images/line_1.PNG" alt="trenn"/></div>

    <h2>Intensity</h2>

    The intensity can also be described as the power of a spells effect.
    When choosing to cast a spell, the arcane determines the intensity of the spells effect and chooses to spend an amount of arcane threads between 0 and 5.
    The more threads are spent, the more powerful the spells effect will be.
    This means that the range, duration, impact or other factors are increased.
    <br><br>
    A spell of intensity 0 is relatively harmless and of short duration and small impact, while spells of higher intensity become more powerful, up until an intensity of 5, by which point they can destroy houses or affect large groups of people.
    <br>
    A higher spells intensity often also means that the spell is harder to control and increases possible conflict from the arcane control check the caster must make in order to keep their spells effect under control.
    <br><br>
    Determining a spells intensity can be a bit daunting and is not really straight forward as no two people might have the same idea of a spells intensity and its costs.
    The most effective way around that is to just talk about it in the moment a character creates an arcane effect.
    <br>
    The GM and the respective player can then determine exactly how much arcane threads must be spend in order for the spell to be cast exactly as envisioned, or they can modify the spells description and its costs.

    <div class="trenn"><img class="trennLine" src="images/line_9.PNG" alt="trenn"/></div>

    <h2>Controlling a Spell</h2>
    
    When casting an arcane spell the characters need to keep the effect they created from the arcane weave under control.
    To do so, they roll an arcane check.
    <br><br>
    Based on their roll and the spells intensity, they will <span style="color: #9bbb59"><strong>keep the control of the spell until it is resolved</span> |
       <span style="color: #c19c0b">receive feedback or weak conflict from casting the spell</span> | 
       <span style="color: #ba372a">suffer more severe conflict or maybe even tear open reality, allowing Null to invade reality</strong></span>. 
    
    <div class="trenn"><img class="trennLine" src="images/line_7.PNG" alt="trenn"/></div>

    <h2>Null</h2>
    
    The fabric of reality is but a thin veil that lays over the primal chaos of the Null dimension that forms behind it that usually lies still.
    Once Arcanes begin drawing out threads from the fabric to create magical effects however, it becomes unstable and dangerous.
    Heavy manipulation or losing control of a spell can lead to rifts and tears appearing in the vicinity, as the threads that usually are responsibly for holding reality together, are being used for other means.
    <br><br>
    These rifts open up ways for the Null to escape its own nothingness of the primal chaos and make its way into reality until the rifts close up again.
    This chaotic and unpredictable phenomenon can have many forms, but most of the time bright pink and jagged crystals will be involved.
    These crystals seek out and destroy arcanes and their magic they come into contact with and should they not be contained, can destroy more than just an inexperienced caster.
    <br><br>
    Other times Null might manifest itself in magical singularities or areas of magical denial, drawing in arcane threads from the closest sources or shutting down magic entirely until the tear in reality closes again.
    <br>
    Null can be used by the GM as a form of conflict for arcane spellcasting checks.

    <div class="trenn"><img class="trennLine" src="images/line_2.PNG" alt="trenn"/></div>
    
    <h2>Static Magic</h2>
    
    Although most static magic was once a subset of the arcane, these effects and spells that manifested themselves in reality, became their own and allow even for those who do not connect directly with the arcane weave, to wield magical and supernatural abilities, talents and effects.
    <br><br>
    Static magic is represented by a number of talents, most of them of a supernatural nature, but still connected to many areas of play, like trickery, medicine or insight.
    They are marked by the "static" tag which is used to add additional effects to talents. See also the list of talents at the end of the rules for more information on certain static talents.
    <br><br>
    Many of these talents can be treated either as innate abilities and traits, or as static spells, magic made stable.
    They make use of the innate connection of all living beings to the arcane threads that make up reality and use them as costs.
