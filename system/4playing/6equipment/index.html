    <h1>Equipment</h1>

    <h2>Money</h2>

    There are 3 types of coins in the world of Akudia.
    The specific coins can be different from continent to continent or even change based on country or region.
    The 3 types stay the same though, which is mostly done due to keeping it easy to keep track of money during a campaign.

    <strong>Copper</strong>
    <br>
    The most basic type of coin and the one with the smallest value.
    Copper coins are worth roughly 1€ each and are sometimes broken into smaller pieces called quarts.
    Quarts are only really used by the poor or when prices can not be negotiated to be a whole number.
    10 copper coins equal 1 silver coin.

    <strong>Silver</strong>
    <br>
    Silver coins are most common in cities and towns and hold a value of roughly 10€.
    They are used for nearly all medium to big purchases, ranging from fine food to simple weapons or clothing.
    Although 100 silver coins equal 1 gold coin, silver coins are sometimes used in bigger quantities like 500 or more to trade, simply because gold coins are so much more rare.
    
    <div class="trenn"><img class="trennLine" src="images/equipment/gold_1.png" alt="trenn"/></div>

    <strong>Gold</strong>
    <br>
    Gold coins are the biggest and most valuable coins and represent roughly 1000€.
    They are quite rare and mostly used by wealthy merchants or lords and kings.
    Most workers and peasants will likely never possess more than a handful of gold coin in their life and even someone who might be considerably wealthy might only ever use silver coins for their big purchases.

    <h2>Weapons</h2>
    The most important part of every warriors and most adventurers armory includes a slew of deadly, special and even magical weapons.
    And although Ambitions rules are not focused on combat and fighting alone, they can come into play often enough that being unarmed is not always a smart idea.
    <br><br>
    Below you will find all the information you need to understand and use weapons for your characters.
    <br>
    Weapons are structured like this:
    
    <br><br>

    <strong>Name</strong> - type - effects
    
    Besides their name, every weapon has a number of tags, some more broad than others, that determine the type and make of the weapon and help in identifying which boons and flaws are are added to checks made with this weapon.
    Lastly, many weapons have one or more effects that make them special, similarly as to how talents make the player characters truly unique.
    These effects can range from simple boons or flaws when using the weapon, to special effects and magical powers.
    
    <br><br>

    Some simple weapons could look like this:
    <br>
    <span style="color: #6f8dbd"><i><strong>Rusty sword</strong></i> - medium, sword - Gain a flaw when you use this item in a skirmish check</span>
    <br>
    <span style="color: #6f8dbd"><i><strong>Shortbow</strong></i> - light, bow</span>
    <br>
    <span style="color: #6f8dbd"><i><strong>Well kept spear</strong></i> - medium, spear - Gain a boon when you use this item in a skirmish check</span>
    <br><br>
    An example for a more complex weapon could be the following:
    <br>
    <span style="color: #6f8dbd"><i><strong>Voice thief</strong></i> - light, dagger - When damaging a creature with this dagger, they are silenced for 10 seconds, being unable to make any sounds. You can use their voice for the duration.</span>
    
    <br><br>

    In chapter TODO you will find many more examples of weapons.
    
    <br><br>

    <strong>Type</strong>
    <br>
    The tags of a weapon are important when checking boons and flaws during skirmish checks and are also relevant for certain talents.
    Weapons can have multiple tags depending on their make, type, size etc.
    
    <br><br>

    All weapons have a general type which determines their size and weight:

    <ul>
      <li><strong>light</strong></li>
      <li><strong>medium</strong></li>
      <li><strong>heavy</strong></li>
    </ul>

    Furthermore all weapons have a specific type that determines form, use and design.
    <br>
    Here are some examples:
      <div class="col-md-3">
        <ul>
          <li><strong>dagger</strong></li>
          <li><strong>sword</strong></li>
          <li><strong>spear</strong></li>
          <li><strong>axe</strong></li>
          <li><strong>hammer</strong></li>
          <li><strong>mace</strong></li>
          <li><strong>fist</strong></li>
          <li><strong>whip</strong></li>
          <li><strong>hook</strong></li>
          <li><strong>scythe</strong></li>
          <li><strong>bow</strong></li>
          <li><strong>crossbow</strong></li>
          <li><strong>sling</strong></li>
          <li><strong>pistol</strong></li>
          <li><strong>rifle</strong></li>
          <li><strong>cannon</strong></li>
          <li><strong>blowgun</strong></li>
          <li><strong>boomerang</strong></li>
          <li><strong>javelin</strong></li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>
    
    Combine one of the former and one of the latter types and almost any weapon can be generated.
    A shortsword would gain the light and sword tags for example, while a halberd might gain heavy and axe.
    
    <br><br>

    Certain unique items can have a specialized tag that only they have.

    <h2>Clothing</h2>
    
    Another important aspect of adventuring is of course your style.
    By wearing clothes, armor or other items, you not only cover yourself and protect yourself from the elements, you also gain access to many interesting and powerful effects.
    
    Clothing tunics, trousers, shoes and socks, hats, helmets, armor, jewelry and rings, armbands and scarfs and everything else that can be worn.

    <br><br>
    
    <strong>Armor</strong>
    <br>
    Some items offer extra protection, armor so to speak, whcih is determined by an armor value.
    Most single items do not offer much protection and must be combined with others to form a set, while more powerful items can provide an armor bonus by themselves.
    <br>
    An armor value can be used when a character gains a wound and reduces the level of the wound by an amount up to their armor value.
    <br>
    The armor items take the wound instead, reducing the armor value they provide by the amount they blocked. Items can be repaired or refreshed to restore their armor value.

    <br><br>
    
    Similar to weapons, all clothing items have a name and type that determines what kind of item it is, how it can be worn and what it could look like.
    LMany clothing items also have some form of special effects that can be used while they are worn.

    <br>

    <strong>Name</strong> - type - effects

    <br><br>
    
    Examples for simple clothing items could look like this:
    
    <span style="color: #6f8dbd"><i><strong>Heavy leather bracer</i> - bracer - 1 armor value</span></strong>
    
    <span style="color: #6f8dbd"><i><strong>Trivium mantle</i> - cloak - You gain +2 arcane threads</span></strong>
    
    <span style="color: #6f8dbd"><i><strong>Platemail armor</i> - breastplate - You gain +2 armor value and the following flaws while wearing it: agility, trickery.</span></strong>

    <div class="trenn"><img class="trennLine" src="images/line_10.png" alt="trenn"/></div>
    
    <h2>Consumables</h2>
    
    <h3>Potions</h3>
    
    Potions can also be used to portray food or drink or other consumables and include many forms of different effects when ingested.
    They serve as the main way to gain positive status effects, such as magic resistance, extra strength or increased healing.
    Every effect imaginable can be made into a potion in one way or another and they last a certain amount of time until their effects runs out.
    <br><br>
    Examples for potions are:
    <br>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Strengthening brew</strong> Affected creatures gain boons: agility x2, skirmish.</li>
      <li><strong>Anti magic tea</strong> Drinking this tea makes temporarily immune to certain arcane elements or magic altogether.</li>
      <li><strong>Healing supplement</strong> Increases the rate at which wounds heal, allowing to heal an additional lvl 1 wound during a rest.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <br><br>

    <h3>Poisons</h3>
    
    Poisons work in many ways, most of them detrimental to adventuring, either by damaging a character over time, or by weakening or otherwise restricting them.
    They serve as the opposite to potions, representing the negative effects gained by consuming them.
    Each poison works differently but most of them last until they are treated or it runs its course.
    <br><br>
    Characters can suffer poisons from ingesting, inhaling, getting injected or wounded by a poisoned weapon.
    <br><br>
    Examples for poisons are:
    <br>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Weakening poison</strong> Affected creatures gain flaws: agility, skirmish x2.</li>
      <li><strong>Damaging poison</strong> Affected creatures gain a lvl 1 wound every hour.</li>
      <li><strong>Paralyzing poison</strong> Paralyzes the victim and makes them unable to move.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>General Inventory</h2>
    Most of the general gear a character has on them can be described as adventuring supplies and gear, such as a bedroll or a tent for resting, lanterns for light, cooking utensils, small tools for repairs, etc.
    
    They do not really need special mechanics, as they usually do what you would expect of them.
    Most of the time it is less about the items themselves and more about how the characters make use of them, that determines their impact on the game and the story.
    
    Carrying a lightsource for example could make vigilance or trickery checks easier, as the character can see what they are doing.
    The flipside however is, that physical activity is a little bit more difficult while carrying a torch for example, agility checks could have conflict that extinguishes the torch for example.
    
    A bedroll or a way to make camp and a fire, as well as something to cook your food can increase the comfort during a rest and make sure, that you really recover during the night.
    
    Tools and gadgets can become important when repairing or fixing your equipment.
    Medical supplies should always be carried, as they can be useful when treating wounds and injuries.
    
    Just think of what would make sense in the story and what your characters realistically would carry on their adventures.
