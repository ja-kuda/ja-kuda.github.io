    <h1>Playing the Game</h1>

    This chapter includes everything else that can be important during a game of Ambition.
    You will find mechanics and rules for a variety of different aspects of the game, like magic, crafting, equipment and also characters being injured or even dying.

    <br><br>

    Some of these chapters, like the arcane or crafting can become important for some players, others will be relevant for all of the players, like injuries and death, but these rules are not as vitally important to the game, as everything that came before.
