    <h1>Death</h1>
    Every once in a while a characters ambition and allies are not enough to save them from being struck down and dying.
    <br><br>
    If a characters gains a wound, when all of their wounds of an equal or higher level are already filled, they gain a lvl 4 wound, killing them.
    Alternatively, when a character gains a lvl 4 wound on its own, they die.
    <br><br>
    That moment marks an important decision for the characters soul:
    They can either choose to accept their death, granting them a last action of heroic sacrifice or they can try and bargain with Aestor, the god of balance and the keeper of souls.
    <br><br>
    In the moment of a characters death the players must choose between acceptance and bargain:

    <h2>Acceptance</h2>
    A character can accept that they will certainly die and take a last stand, a heroic sacrifice for their companions, their faith or simply to spite the thing that killed them.
    <br><br>
    The character has the chance to gather their remaining strength to perform an action that will turn the tides of battle and can surpass the limits of a normal action by several magnitudes.
    They can choose an action to perform that is within their powers, but can surpass their limits, resolving it automatically without rolling a check.
    <br><br>
    <span style="color: #6f8dbd"><i>An arcane is struck by an enemies weapon and will surely die. They accept their fate and decide to take a last stand. They gather their remaining strength, and although they do not have any more arcane threads left, create a fiery explosion around themselves to incinerate all of the enemies that surrounded them, saving their imprisoned allies.</i></span>
    <br><br>
    Characters souls that take a last stand, do not get to decide, whether they return to life, they are dead, no matter what and do not wander into Limbo but are instead dissolved immediately after their last stand.

    <h2>Bargain</h2>
    Upon a characters death their soul detaches from their body and is brought before Aestor who determines the souls fate.
    <br><br>
    By making a bargain and offering a piece of themselves, characters get to make a final check to see, if the ascended accepts their offering and returns them to life once more, marked by their choice.
    This offering can be a quest for the god of death, something material dear to the character, a physical, mental or emotional piece of the character, such as gaining a permanent flaw or losing access to some of their abilities.
    <br><br>
    This check is made not with a number of dice and a skill, but instead with a single d12.
    <br><br>
    The checks results are as follows:
    <br>
    <span style="color: #9bbb59"><b>The character clings onto life and escapes death for now.</b></span>
    <br>
    <span style="color: #c19c0b"><b>The character escapes death narrowly, fatigued and stressed.</b></span>
    <br>
    <span style="color: #ba372a"><b>The character dies for good and their soul leaves their body, wandering into Limbo.</b></span>
    <br><br>
    Having not accepted their death, the characters soul is send to Limbo where it waits until it is lost in time.
    Limbo should be treated as a waiting room of sorts, storing the souls of dead characters for an undefined amount of time.
    As long as a player wants to be able to revive their character, the soul stays in Limbo, being able to be contacted by others.

    <h2>Resurrection</h2>
    Failing a bargain check made after a character dies, lets their soul escape from their body to wander into limbo where it waits until it is their turn to find its final resting place.
    Characters that accepted their death with a last stand, will not be able to be revived, as their soul no longer exists in Limbo
    <br><br>
    As long as a soul is in limbo they can be contacted through the use of the right rituals, spells, artifacts, etc. and a soul can then be convinced to return to its body or another vessel. To convince a soul to return to reality it first needs to be contacted and found in limbo and the original body or another suitable vessel needs to be present.
    <br><br>
    If the soul can be reached, a resurrection ritual can begin. A character that knows the resurrectionist talent or an arcane that controls the life element can try their hand at it.
    (There can of course be more options to revive characters, this is solely based on the feel and tone of your campaign. Maybe everyone knows how to resurrect the dead as part of the story, or maybe there are certain items that can be used to revive someone.)
    <br><br>
    A resurrection ritual needs participants to complete, the more the better, as each participant in the ritual will have to bring an offering in the hopes of convincing Aestor to let the soul return and allow it to bind to the vessel.
    These offerings do not have to be materialistic in nature, they can be anything the participant can think of that might help in aiding the soul to return to the reality. Each character then makes a check based on their offering, such as a performance, challenge or ritual of their own.
    <br><br>
    Each successful check that is made as part of the resurrection ritual helps to further bind the soul to the vessel, partially successful checks can lead to complications and failed checks might weaken the bond of soul and body.
    <br><br>
    After all participants brought their offerings and made their checks, the GM will tally the checks results and based on the highest number of successes, partial successes and failures, 
    the resurrected character will <span style="color: #9bbb59">return back to life</span> | <span style="color: #c19c0b">return to life but with complications like limited time or restrictions to their body</span> | <span style="color: #ba372a">not be able to return to life and their soul will dissolve</span>.
