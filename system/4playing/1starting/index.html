    <h1>Creating a Story</h1>

    Now that you know how to roll checks, what conflict is and have built your characters, it is high time to throw them into some action.

    <h2>The Party</h2>
    
    An important thing to keep in mind is, that at its core, Ambition is a team game, just like many other ttrpgs and similar games, which means that every player should get involved in the creation of the story and have fun doing so.
    To gather the player characters in a group and maybe even cohesive unit of adventurers, a party should be formed, optimally at the beginning of the story.
    The parties goals should align somewhat, as to make it easier for the GM to engage all players in it during the game on a similar level.
    Additionally this ensures, that all players receive roughly the same amount of attention and chances to be in the spotlight.
    <br><br>
    Usually it is assumed, that the party and all of its members work on quests and problems together.
    Of course there can be some scenes, during which the party splits up and sometime

    <h2>Story Arcs</h2>

    The story arcs can be considered as the main quest of the game, which all characters should be invested in.
    <br>
    The story arcs are usually created by the Gm to lead the party through the story and to put them into situations that require them to overcome obstacles, work as a team together or, depending on 
    your style of story, are maybe even put into moral dillemas and personal drama.
    <br><br>
    Story arcs can be as long or as short as you want them to or the story demands and for the most part they will be harder to keep apart from one another as your story progresses.

    <h2>Character Arcs</h2>
    Character Arcs should be treated as filler inbetween the bigger story arcs, as they usually only affect one character at a time.
    The party of course is encouraged to help them, and character arcs can become story arcs that drive the main narrative, but be careful not to put a single player or character
    too much into the spotlight, compared to the rest of the party.
    <br>
    <br>
    Character arcs can be kept relatively short, maybe spanning a single session or even less, but as with many aspects of the game, it depends on your group and style of storytelling.
