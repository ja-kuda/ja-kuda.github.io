    <h1>Creating a Story</h1>

    Now that you know how to roll checks, what conflict is and have built your characters, it is high time to throw them into some action.

    <h2>Arcs</h2>
    During the game and the story, each character can pursue their ambition in different ways, one of them being arcs, small, personal side-quests for each character in a party.
    They are used to strengthen the characters pursuit of their ambition and allow them to increase their maximum resolve over the course of a campaign, making them stronger and better equipped for their adventures.
    
    <br><br>

    <strong>Creating character Arcs</strong>
    <br>
    The players create these arcs together with the GM, based on their own goals for their characters and the current state of the story that is being told.
    When you first enter a segment of the story, work with your GM to create an arc that fits your characters ambition and goals, as well as the surrounding circumstances.
    
    <br><br>

    These arcs can be "bringing a lovers pair together" for a character with the love ambition, or maybe "prevent a war from breaking out" for a character with the peace ambition.
    Due to the nature of these arcs, they can be chosen in a way that fits the current theme and setting of the story.
    
    <br><br>

    Arcs should be chosen in a way that leaves some room for interpretation on the GMs part and also should not be something that can be resolved immediately, but instead take a few sessions to finish.
    This way it can be ensured, that the arcs have some impact on the characters personal stories and also that they can not be abused to always increase the characters maximum resolve.
    
    <br><br>
    
    <strong>Starting a new Arc</strong>
    <br>
    Only once every character in a group achieved their arcs goal, can the players choose new arcs for their characters.
    To prevent a single character to complete arc after arc, a new arc can only be created, after each character in a party fulfilled their own goals.
    This way, characters that already completed their arc, are incentivized to help and support their fellow party members in their arcs.

    <h2>The storyline</h2>

    The different story arcs can be used as a guideline for the GM to create a story that encompasses all of the players arcs and goals for their characters.
    <br>
    The story is usually created by the Gm to lead the party through the story and to put them into situations that require them to overcome obstacles, work as a team together or, depending on 
    your style of story, are maybe even put into moral dillemas and personal drama.
    <br><br>
    The players however are responsible for creating fun and interesting arcs for their respective characters to pursue.
    This way they can have a big impact on the story as a whole, working together with the GM to create an exciting experience.
    <br><br>
    The GM however is still in control of the story at the end of the day, as they are responsible to link the different arcs of the characters together and throw in some of their own ideas to drive the story forward, such as villains and events that act independently from the characters and in the background.
    A story can be as long or as short as you want it to be. Maybe you want ot keep going after a certain story is completed, you can simply transition into a new one by creating new character arcs with your players and
