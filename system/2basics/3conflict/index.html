    <h1>Conflict</h1>

    Wherever Ambitions are pursued and clash with each other, conflict is not far.

    <br><br>

    Conflict serves as the most important tool for GMs to create new situations based on the characters actions and also to resolve less than fully successful checks.

    <br><br>

    It arises whenever a character rolls a check that does not exceed the difficulty set by the GM for an action or in an action scene. 
    During action scenes and tense parts of the game, conflict serves as the driving force and is the main responsibility of creating new situations and dangers for the characters.
    Social situations make use of conflict by changing relationships and attitudes of NPCs and others towards characters or the party as a whole and can - if the conflict is severe enough - lead to more violent action scenes.

    <br><br>

    Conflict comes in two basic forms, based on its severity and impact on the story and the characters.
    In chapter TODO - running the game you will find more detailed ideas for weak and strong conflict for each of the skills and their associated checks, as well as example situations and resulting conflict.

    <br><br>

    <strong>Weak Conflict</strong>
    <br>
    This type of conflict is best used for smaller and less severe consequences and side effects, like small injuries or damage, loss of time or resources or maybe progress towards unwanted outcomes.
    That is not to say, that weak conflict can not be scaled up a little bit, as to represent more daring and tense consequences.
    <br>
    It can be used to create action scenes based on the players actions and put other characters in danger or force them to react to new situations and sources of danger.
    Weak conflict can lead to strong conflict if the characters ignore it for too long.

    <br><br>

    <strong>Strong Conflict</strong>
    <br>
    Strong conflict on the other hand, should be reserved for failed checks or whenever a character chooses to ignore a source of weak conflict which then grows into strong conflict.
    It could mean that a character suffers a heavy wound, has their progress reset or loses items, NPCs or other important things in the process.
    Opportunities are lost and situations can grow worse, the more strong conflict arises during action scenes.

    <h2>The Scale</h2>

    The result of a check is then compared to the scale of success, a measuring tool designed to quickly and consistently show the players and the GM alike, whether an action is successful or not.

    <br><br>

    The scale of success is split up into 3 main parts:

    <br>

    <div class="trenn"><img class="scale" src="images/scale/scale_2_1.png" alt="scale"/></div>

    <br>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <span style="color: #ba372a"><b>Strong conflict</b></span> 1 - 4      
        <br>
        Red checks still move the story forward, the characters will not always achieve what they set out to do with their check and will suffer harsh and unexpected consequences.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span style="color: #c19c0b"><b>Weak conflict</b></span> 5 - 7
        <br>
        Yellow checks allow the characters to succeed on their checks but will add complications and make for not quite perfect outcomes.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span style="color: #9bbb59"><b>No conflict</b></span> 8+
        <br>
        Green checks are successful, the characters achieve their goals with the check and suffer no consequences.
      </li>
    </ul> 

    Whenever something in this game calls for a certain check, the outcomes are color-coded to map them to the scale.
    Take the following check for example:

    <br><br>
    
    <span style="color: #6f8dbd"><i>By rolling an agility check to quickly climb up the side of an airship, a character <span style="color: #9bbb59"><b>manages to reach the top unscathed and ahead of their pursuers</i> | <span style="color: #c19c0b">almost falls off and instead only loses their bag of stolen goods, but manages to safely reach the top</span> | <span style="color: #ba372a">manages to reach the top, but is surprised by an enemy and thrown off, plummeting down</b></span>.</span></span>
