    <h1>Resolve</h1>
    Even though ambitions create conflict, as multiple of them clash, a creatures ambition also allows them to surpass these conflicts on their way to achieve greatness.
    
    The characters are the heroes of their own story and as such can make use of a special resource, called resolve.
    Resolve represents the characters will and their mental and physical reserves which they can use to push forward, escape tricky situations or patch themselves up during a rest.
    Every character has a reserve of resolve they can use.
    Each time they rest, they might regain a certain number of resolve, based on their actions during the day. If a character acted on or in pursuit of their ambition during the day, they will regain their resolve during the night.
    They can also increase their reserves of resolve by completing goals in the sake of their ambitions.
    
    <h2>Using Resolve</h2>
    Resolve is used for two main actions during the game:
    
    \textbf{Reducing conflict / Improving checks}
    Whenever a character suffers conflict, they do not have to just take it, they can choose to alter the outcome in their favour by spending resolve, a resource available to all characters, which allows them to increase any check by one stage, meaning that a failed check (and the resulting strong conflict) becomes a partial success (with weak conflict) and a partial success in turn becomes a full success. 
    
    \textbf{Using abilities}
    Some talents and abilities can be enhanced by using resolve, some others require that the character spends at least a certain amount of resolve to activate its effects.
    These talents often include healing, restoration or reduction of harm in their effects and can be essential to some characters.
    
    <h2>Recovering Resolve</h2>
    A character always regenerates a certain amount of resolve during a rest.
    When resting with their group, they can review their day and if the group finds that they acted upon their ambition, they gain +1 resolve.
    This encourages the players to act on their characters values and allows roleplay heavy players to gain a small edge, maybe inspiring their companions to follow suit.
    
    <h2>Increasing Resolve</h2>
    All characters start out with a maximum of 2 resolve they can spend each day.
    They can however increase this vital resource in one way, by completing a character arc they chose.

    By completing an arc, they gain a permanent +1 to their maximum resolve, increasing their potential for greatness and making them stronger by pursuing their ambitions.
