    <h1>Resolve</h1>

    While Ambitions are the root cause of many conflicts and strife, it is also the main tool in pushing through them and emerging victorious.
    Ambitions create a special resource, called Resolve, in living beings, in this case mainly the protagonists of your stories, the player characters.

    <br><br>

    Resolve represents the characters will and their mental and physical reserves which they can use to push forward, escape tricky situations, use special abilities or patch themselves up during a rest.

    <br><br>

    Every character has a fixed reserve of resolve they can use during their adventures.
    Whenever something in the rules costs X resolve, that amount has to be spent from the reserve, to gain the effect(s).
    <br>
    Each time the characters rest, they regain 2 resolve.
    If a character acted on or in pursuit of their Ambition since the last time they rested, they can regain additional resolve.
    <br>
    The reserves of resolve can be expanded by completing goals in the sake of the characters Ambitions, called Arcs.

    <h2>Spending Resolve</h2>

    Resolve is used for two main actions during the game:

    <br><br>

    <strong>Rerolling checks</strong>
    <br>
    By spending 1 resolve a check can be rerolled. All dice that were used in a check can be rolled again and the new result must be used as the result of the original check.

    <br><br>

    <strong>Using abilities</strong>
    <br>
    Some talents and abilities can be enhanced by using resolve, others require that the character spends at least a certain amount of resolve to activate its effects.
    These talents often include healing, restoration or reduction of harm in their effects and can be especially powerful.

    <br><br>

    Other uses of resolve include healing more severe wounds during a rest or spending Resolve as part of a magical bargain or deal.

    <h2>Recovering Resolve</h2>

    Player characters always regenerate a certain minimum amount of resolve during a rest.
    Usually this amount is 1, but based on your campaign, you might decide to instead recover all, or no resolve, or anything in between, to invoke a certain feeling an availability of this meta resource.

    <br><br>

    When resting with their group, the players can review their characters actions and if the group finds that they acted upon their Ambition, they gain additional Resolve.
    Each player can receive 2 additional Resolve in this way.
    This encourages the players to act on their characters values and allows role-play heavy players to gain a small edge, maybe inspiring their companions to follow suit.

    <br><br>

    Some talents might allow characters to regain Resolve in other ways than the two listed here, maybe by exchanging another resource at their disposal, like their wounds, arcane threads or talent charges.

    <h2>Resolve Reserves</h2>

    All characters start out with a maximum of 2 Resolve they can spend each day.
    
    <br><br>
    
    They can however increase this vital resource in one way and one way only: By completing a character arcs.
    Arcs are smaller, tangible goals that the players set for their characters, one at a time, which upon completion, increase a characters Resolve reserves by +1.
    Arcs are described in detail in chapter TODO! characters
