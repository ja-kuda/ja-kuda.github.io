    <h1>Resolve</h1>

    While Ambitions are the root cause of many conflicts and strife, it is also the main tool in pushing through them and emerging victorious.
    Ambitions create a special resource, called Resolve, in living beings, in this case mainly the protagonists of your stories, the player characters.

    <br><br>

    Resolve represents the characters will and their mental and physical reserves which they can use to push forward, escape tricky situations, use special abilities or patch themselves up during a rest.

    <h2>Spending Resolve</h2>

    Resolve is used for two main actions during the game:

    <br><br>

    <strong>Rerolling checks</strong>
    <br>
    By spending 1 resolve a check can be rerolled. All dice that were used in a check can be rolled again and either the new or the original result can be used for the check.

    <br><br>

    <strong>Using abilities</strong>
    <br>
    Some talents and abilities can be enhanced by using resolve, others require that the character spends at least a certain amount of resolve to activate its effects.
    These talents are usually more powerful and can shape the story in a meaningful way, which is why they are limited more than normal talents or abilities.

    <h2>Recovering Resolve</h2>

    As Resolve acts a meta resource meant to shape the story and improve roleplay, it is not regenerated by simply resting or taking downtime.

    <br><br>

    To regain resolve a character must pursue their ambition or help others in pursuing their ambitions.
    In character roleplay or simply interesting or cool ideas and actions during the game can also gain the character 1 or more resolve.
    <br>
    When a group finishes a story arc, travels to a new location or otherwises finishes up a main quest or something similar, all of their resolve reserves are refreshed as well.

    <br><br>

    By talking to the GM the players might also convince them to gain resolve by spending other resources or maybe you even implement a daily voting system for your party where each player can
    vote for another player to gain 1 resolve.

    <h2>Resolve Reserves</h2>

    All characters start out with a maximum of 2 Resolve they can spend.
    
    <br><br>
    
    They can however increase this vital resource in one way and one way only: By completing character arcs.
    Arcs are smaller, tangible goals that the players set for their characters, one at a time, which upon completion, increase a characters Resolve reserves by +1.
    Arcs are described in detail in chapter TODO! Arcs
