    <h1>How to play</h1>
    In its most basic form, Ambition presents a conversation between the players and the GM to create stories.
    For the most part, this conversation can be as open-ended and creative as you make it.
    All players take part in the creation of these stories, either by roleplaying and acting out their characters, or by creating the world, the people and creatures that inhabit it and the situations the characters find themselves in.
    
    At its core, this conversation and the resulting story are the main focus of both players and GM and should always be held in a high regard.
    All actions that characters take, all situations the GM creates and everything that happens during play should aim to drive the narrative forward.
    
    For the most part of the game, the characters can talk among themselves or interact with the world around them, talking to NPCs, exploring their surroundings, finding new and exciting items, etc.
    
    It is only when the characters act on situations that have stakes or try to take risky actions, that the core mechanic of Ambition comes into play and dice are rolled:
    Whenever the GM feels that an outcome is not clear or a character has a reasonable chance to fail or complicate a situation with their actions, a check is made.
    These checks range from climbing, prying open doors, hiding, over crafting, fighting and casting spells, to persuading followers, parleying and even dancing and singing.
    
    The results of checks then lead to new situations or change existing situations up, thus driving the story forward.
    
    So the conversation follows a pattern just like this most of the time:
    
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The characters freely interact with the world around them through roleplaying and conversation
        \item The GM presents a certain situation
        \item A character interacts with the situation and takes a risky action or does something that can change the story
        \item A check is made and the results are resolved
        \item The GM reacts to the results of any checks made and presents a new situation
        \item Repeat or return to freely interacting
    \end{itemize}
