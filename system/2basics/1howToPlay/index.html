    <h1>How to Play</h1>

    Ambition aims to create collaborative stories made up by the players and their characters, as well as the GM and the world they control.
    The gameplay mainly focuses on a conversation between all players and the GM to create scenes and moments that can be as creative and open ended as you like.
    To resolve conflicts and determine success or failure, dice are rolled and give the stories some unexpected and chaotic twists and turns.

    <br><br>

    Two of the most basic scenes used in the story are roleplay and action scenes.

    <br><br>

    <strong>Roleplay scenes</strong>

    <br>

    Roleplay scenes represent the default state of the game, the players are free to interact with the world and each other in character and can choose when, how, where and why to follow plothooks or quests set out by the GM.

    <br><br>

    <strong>Action scenes</strong>

    <br>

    Action scenes on the other hand are situations in which the outcome is not clear and which can have consequences for the characters.
    Action scenes often require at least one, sometimes more than one check, to resolve conflict and create a new situation or scene.
    These checks range from climbing, prying open doors, hiding, over crafting, fighting and casting spells, to persuading followers, parleying and even dancing and singing.

    <br><br>

    These two basic types of scenes make up a majority of the story of your game and can be strung together in any way or form you like.

    <h2>The story</h2>

    The story should be the main focus of the GM and the players, as it is the result of any decisions you make during the game.
    All players take part in the creation of the story, either by roleplaying and acting out their characters, or by creating the world, the people and creatures that inhabit it and the situations the characters find themselves in.

    <br><br>

    All actions that characters take, all situations the GM creates and everything that happens during play drives the narrative forward.
    Be it characters interacting with NPCs or themselves during roleplay scenes or them trying to achieve something during action scenes, the players should never be inactive and try to find ways for their characters to have an impact on the story.

    <br><br>

    The same goes for the GM, they should always try and drive the story forward through new and exciting situations and scenes based on the players choices.
    To gauge how and when to create new situations, the different levels of conflict and the grades of success can be of help.

    <br><br>

    You will notice, that there are no real options for failure in the chapters for checks and conflict.
    Even rolling the worst possible result on a check still allows the players to impact the narrative, albeit with complications and hardships.
