    <h1>Ambition</h1>
    
    Although the world is inhabited by a countless number of creatures - intelligent and also less so - and individuals that each strive for their survival, dominance or to immortalize their name in the annals of history, there is one thing that unites them all, the namesake of this game:
    
    \textbf{Ambition}
    
    A driving force that is innate to every living creature and person and that not only serves as motivation and guidance, but also as an integral part of the fabric of reality, or more precisely, the arcane fabric.
    Each creature that strives to achieve and perpetuate their ambition, unknowingly powers the powers behind the world itself.
    Ambition is the root and the goal at the same time and allows for ordinary people to become one with reality.
    Ambition is what creates resolve in people, and allows them to always push themselves further.
    
    The player characters of course have this ambition as well, using it to become stronger and more refined in their adventures and personal quests.
    Though they do not necessarily need to know why, their ambitions always drive them, allowing them to withstand even the harshest circumstances and situations and (hopefully) always come out ahead.
    
    Ambitions become relevant during character creation and of course during the actual game, guiding the characters and making them stronger.
    During longer campaigns, characters choose goals that align with their chosen ambitions and, if pursued, allow them to gain additional benefits through them.
    These goals are called arcs.
    
    Ambition comes in many forms and can cover a lot of topics, the most common ambitions are broad concepts, like friendship, greed, power, freedom, justice, solace, etc. and more real aspects like family, war, money, food, home, etc.
    There are no strict rules for choosing an ambition and the players should not feel restricted by them, instead using them as guidelines and helping hands for acting out their characters.
    
    Players can choose to act on their ambitions during the game and recover additional resolve during their rests this way, this is however not absolutely necessary and instead serves as a motivation to create and play more complex characters.
    
    When you create a character choose an ambition and which aspect of it you want your character to embody, you can use the following list as inspiration or choose your very own ambition:
