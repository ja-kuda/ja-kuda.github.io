    <h1>Conflict</h1>
    Wherever those, that seek to work towards their ambitions, are, conflict is not far.
    Created by the very thing every being tries to achieve, it creates conflict and blocks their way and makes them struggle.
    
    Conflict serves as the most important tool for the GM to create new situations based on the characters actions and also to change up the difficulty of a given check by increasing its complications and consequences.
    
    It arises whenever a character rolls a check for an action and either fails (red) or has a partial success (yellow) and represents the complications and consequences of their actions.
    During action-packed and tense parts of the game, conflict serves as the driving force and is the main responsibility of creating new situations and dangers for the characters.
    During quieter parts of the game, conflict is rather used to determine long-term consequences and the quality of certain actions, such as crafting or researching.
    Social situations make use of conflict by changing relationships and attitudes of NPCs and others towards characters or the party as a whole and can - if the conflict is severe enough - lead to combat or otherwise suspenseful encounters.
    
    Conflict comes in two basic forms, based on its severity and impact on the story and the characters.
    In chapter TODO - running the game you will find more detailed ideas for weak and strong conflict for each of the skills and their associated checks, as well as example situations and resulting conflict.
    
    <h2>Weak conflict</h2>
    This type of conflict is best used for smaller and less severe consequences and side effects, like small injuries or damage, loss of time or resources or maybe progress towards unwanted outcomes.
    That is not to say, that weak conflict can not be scaled up a little bit, as to represent more daring and tense consequences.
    
    It can be used to create new situations as reactions to players actions and put other characters in danger as to force them to react to new situations and sources of danger.
    Weak conflict can lead to strong conflict if the characters ignore the consequences of it for too long.
    
    <h2>Strong conflict</h2> 
    Strong conflict on the other hand, should be reserved for failed checks or whenever a character chooses to ignore a source of weak conflict which then grows into strong conflict.
    It could mean that a character suffers a heavy wound, has their progress reset or loses items, NPCs or other important things in the process.
    Opportunities are lost and situations can grow worse, the more strong conflict arises during a scene.
