    <h1>Checks</h1>

    Every time a character tries to take an action or does something that has reasonable stakes, they state what they are doing and what they wish to accomplish with it.
    Based on that description by the playsers, the GM then can call for a check by asking a player to roll a certain skill.
    Skills will be described in detail in their respective chapters in the character creation.

    <h3>Dice</h3>
    The basic dice for all checks are a number of d6.
    The skill used in the check determines the number of dice that are rolled when asked to make a check.

    In some cases one or more of the d6 can be increased or decreased in size.

    <h3>Skills</h3>
    The skills of a character determine how many dice are rolled in a specific check and represent the training a character has in a certain type of action like skirmish, medicine or performance.
    Skills range from 0 to 5 and show the number of d6 that are rolled.
    There is one exception to this rule, a skill with 0 does not roll 0 d6, but instead 1d4.

    \textcolor{example}{\emph{Damo the thief is running from the guards across the rooftops of the city. He wants to jump across a gap between two houses and unroll on the other side to keep his momentum and speed up. The GM calls for an agility check to escape the guards and keep running.}}

    \textcolor{example}{\emph{Luna the sorceress is right behind him and is unsure of her footing and her ability to safely make it to the other side. She wants to find for a safer way that also lets her escape the guards. In this case the GM might call for a vigilance check to be made, so she can quickly look for a more safe route across the rooftops.}}

    Not every action necessarily has to call for a check, situations without tension or actions and activities that are inconsequential or can not really fail, can often be resolved by simply stating what happens.
    The GM can make this decision based on the players description and can decide if an action fails or succeeds and lead the players into the next situation.

    \textcolor{example}{\emph{Tunis the ranger wants to set up a trap for small animals to catch something to eat for the night. They did this a thousand times and should really know how to do it effectively and quickly. They just do it without making a check and later on find a rabbit caught in the trap.}}

    \textcolor{example}{\emph{An adventuring party wants to ask around town for the description of a convict on the run. The GM concludes, that if they take their time, they just gain some information without rolling a check, as they just ask everybody the same questions and finally someone points them towards a small rundown house.}}

    <h2>Intent</h2>

    The better the players describe their actions and wanted outcomes, the more easy it is for the GM to call for an appropriate check.

    When taking an action to resolve a situation, a character should always try and describe what they are doing, how they are doing it and what they hope to achieve with that action.

    If a player thinks they should make a different check for their characters actions, they can ask the GM to reconsider or try to explain their ideas more detailed.
    In these case the GM can choose to allow for a different check to be made or stay with their initial choice, as they have the last word.

    NOTE: These discussions should always be held short and of course respectfully, as to not disrupt the flow of the game. Sometimes it is better to just go with a ruling and later on discuss it in more detail and learn from it for the next time.

    <h2>How to roll</h2>

    When rolling a check the player rolls a number of d6 based on their attribute for the check and chooses the highest of the dice as their result.

    If one or more dice roll their max value they are rolled again and added to the previous roll, this can happen multiple times, should both dice roll their max value they are both rolled again and the highest of those is added to the previous result.

    The following examples should give you an idea of how checks are made:

    \textcolor{example}{\emph{3d6 result in 2, 4 and 5, the result is a 5.}}

    \textcolor{example}{\emph{2d6 result in 2 and 6, the player rolls the one die again for a 3, the result is 9 (6+3)}}

    \textcolor{example}{\emph{4d6 result in 1, 3, 6 and 6, the player rolls two dice again for 1 and 3, the result is 9 (6+3)}}

    \textcolor{example}{2d6 result in 2 and 6, the player rolls one die again for a 6. The player then rolls this die another time for a 2, the result is 14 (6+6+2)}

    <h2>Grades of Success</h2>
    The result of a check is then compared to the scale of success, a measuring tool designed to quickly and consistently show the players and the GM alike, whether an action is successful or not.

    The scale of success is split up into 3 main parts and an implied 4th one.
    The main parts are as follows:

    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textcolor{scala_green}{Full success} 9 - 15
        \item \textcolor{scala_yellow}{Partial success} 5 - 8
        \item \textcolor{scala_red}{Failure} 1 - 4
    \end{itemize}

    A full success means, that the character that rolled the check, achieves their goal and does what they wanted to do with their action.

    A partial success may mean that characters basically achieve what they set out to do, but it is fraught with conflict. For example, there may be reduced impact or subsequent complications. (See also conflict for more information)

    Failed checks are, as the name implies, not successful and even come with harsher complications and often strong conflict. The characters do not achieve what they set out to do, but the story still moves forward.

    Whenever something in this book calls for a certain check, the outcomes are color-coded and mapped to the three different grades of success.
    Take the following checks for example:

    \textcolor{example}{\emph{By rolling an agility check to quickly climb up the side of an airship, a character \textcolor{scala_green}{manages to reach the top unscathed and ahead of their pursuers} $\vert$ \textcolor{scala_yellow}{almost falls off and instead only lose their bag of stolen goods, is slowed down and caught up by their enemies or fills a wound to reach the top.} $\vert$ \textcolor{scala_red}{fails to reach the top and maybe even falls off or is otherwise thrown into a new and difficult situation}.}}

    \textcolor{example}{\emph{An arcane character uses their magic powers to shoot lightning at a creature by rolling an arcane check and \textcolor{scala_green}{destroys it with a thundering shockwave, throwing all that surround it off balance} $\vert$ \textcolor{scala_yellow}{severely hurts it, but it manages to shrug off some of the damage and turns toward the character} $\vert$ \textcolor{scala_red}{misses the creature with the spell or maybe the creature blocks the spells effect and withstands it}.}}

    The green text shows options you can choose from on a successful roll, the yellow text shows you options for partially successful rolls, while the red text shows you the failed outcome. In most cases the red options are omitted, they are simply handled as failed rolls. If failed checks have additional effects, they are listed like the others.

    \textbf{Critical success}

    Beyond full successes, there are critically successful checks, these are rare and should include a special reward for the character.
    Whenever a checks result exceed the scale of success, they achieve a critical success, adding greater effects and positive additions to the resolution of the check.
    These can include gaining another action instantly, not letting anyone react, gaining additional information or resources or making a lasting impression on witnesses.

    Using resolve on a successful check does not make it a critical success, only rolling high enough or the use of certain talents allows for a critical success to occur.

    <h2>Progress and Scope</h2>
    
    Usually a check resolves an action or situation and creates a new one to put the characters in.

    Sometimes though things take a little more time and can not easily be resolved with a single check.
    A long awaited duel between a character and their rival, the taming of a wild beast or crafting a complex invention are not that easily resolved with a single check.
    To allow the characters to undertake longer and more complicated activities and still add a little factor of randomness and their abilities, a checks scope and progress can be modified.

    Instead of handling a skirmish check as a whole fight between two characters, you might find it more fitting to act out the individual feints and strikes in more detail, making checks for each of them, allowing the characters to make more detailed decisions.

    Instead of simply stating that a character repaired their airship during a downtime, you might want to let them make multiple checks for different stages of the crafting process, each of them repairing or damaging the ship a little more.

    The scope and gained progress of checks should be set by the GM based on the story and the situation at hand and usually a check should always be able to resolve a certain situation by creating a new situation that takes the first ones place.
    Changing up the scope should be used for special scenes that either have an emotional impact on the story or represent a situation better as a part of multiple checks chained together to achieve a single outcome.
