    <h1>Checks</h1>

    Every time a character tries to take an action or does something that has reasonable stakes, they state what they are doing and what they wish to accomplish with it.
    Based on that description by the players, the GM then can call for a check by asking a player to roll a certain skill.

    <br><br>

    Not every action necessarily has to call for a check, situations without tension or actions and activities that are inconsequential or have no real repercussions if they go awry can often be resolved by simply stating what happens.
    The GM can make this decision based on the players description and can decide if and how an action leads the players into the next situation.

    <br><br>

    <h2>Intention</h2>

    It is one of the players main jobs to detail their characters actions in such a way, taht the GM can deduce a way for the story to move forward and lead the game into a new scene.
    The better the players describe their actions and wanted outcomes, the more easy it is for the GM to call for an appropriate check.

    <br><br>

    When being asked, what their character wants to do to resolve a situation, a player should always try and describe what they are doing, how they are doing it and what they hope to achieve with that action.
    Based on that description, the GM then calls for a check.

    <br><br>

    If a player thinks they should make a different check for their characters actions, they can ask the GM to reconsider or try to explain their ideas more detailed.
    In these case the GM can choose to allow for a different check to be made or stay with their initial choice, as they have the last word.

    <br><br>

    <span style="color: #6f8dbd"><i>Damo the thief is running from the guards across the rooftops of the city. He wants to jump across a gap between two houses and unroll on the other side to keep his momentum and speed up. The GM calls for an agility check to escape the guards and keep running.</i></span>

    <br><br>

    <span style="color: #6f8dbd"><i>Luna the sorceress is right behind him and is unsure of her footing and her ability to safely make it to the other side. She wants to find for a safer way that also lets her escape the guards. In this case the GM might call for a vigilance check to be made, so she can quickly look for a more safe route across the rooftops.</i></span>

    <br><br>

    NOTE: These discussions should always be held short and of course respectfully, as to not disrupt the flow of the game. Sometimes it is better to just go with a ruling and later on discuss it in more detail and learn from it for the next time.

    <br><br>

    <h2>Scope and Progress</h2>

    Usually a check resolves an action or situation and creates a new one to put the characters in.
    Most of the time this means, that a single check is enough to resolve an action as set out by the players roleplay.

    <br><br>

    <span style="color: #6f8dbd"><i>An adventuring party needs to escape a crumbling ruin or temple. On their way out, some minor enemies try to block their escape. To keep the scene running and to create a feeling of urgency, getting through one of these foes can be handled by a single check for each character, maybe killing or dodging them completely on a successful check.</i></span>

    <br><br>

    Sometimes though things take a little more time and can not easily be resolved with a single check.
    A long awaited duel between a character and their rival, the taming of a wild beast or crafting a complex invention are not that easily resolved with a single check.
    Instead of handling a skirmish check as a whole fight between two characters, you might find it more fitting to act out the individual feints and strikes in more detail, making checks for each of them, allowing the characters to make more detailed decisions.

    <br><br>

    <span style="color: #6f8dbd"><i>A character has to duel their former master in a one on one battle to the death. To increase dramatic tensions and make the fight suspenseful and important, the GM could ask the player to describe in more detail what their character does during the fight, maybe even breaking the fight down to making checks for single sword strokes until one of them finally falls.</i></span>

    <br><br>

    On the other hand, checks should only be called by the GM if there is a realistic chance of failure and possible interesting outcomes that can arise from conflict created by these checks.
    Simple tasks or those, that have no real consequences can be easily done through roleplaying.

    <br><br>

    <span style="color: #6f8dbd"><i>Tunis the ranger wants to set up a trap for small animals to catch something to eat for the night. They did this a thousand times and should really know how to do it effectively and quickly. They just do it without making a check and later on find a rabbit caught in the trap.</i></span>

    <br><br>

    The scope and gained progress of checks should be set by the GM based on the story and the situation at hand and usually a check should always be able to resolve a certain situation by creating a new situation that takes the first ones place.
    Changing up the scope should be used for special scenes that either have an emotional impact on the story or represent a situation better as a part of multiple checks chained together to achieve a single outcome.

    <br><br>

    <h2>Rolling Checks</h2>

    When rolling a check the player rolls a number of dice based on their skills for the check and chooses the highest of the dice as their result.

    <br><br>

    <strong>Dice</strong>
    <br>
    The basic dice for all checks are a number of d6.
    The size of one or multiple dice can be manipulated through the use of boons and flaws, as well as talents.
    All of those are described in detail in chapter TODO: characters

    <br><br>

    <strong>Skills</strong>
    <br>
    The different skills of a character determine how many dice are rolled when making a check using the respective skill.
    There is one exception to this rule, a skill with 0 does not roll zero d6, but instead a single d4.

    <br><br>

    <h3>Exploding dice</h3>

    If one or more dice roll their maximum value, they explode and are rolled again and added to the previous roll.
    This can happen multiple times, should more than one die roll their maximum value they are both rolled again and the highest of those is added to the previous result.

    <br><br>

    The following examples should give you an idea of how checks are made:

    <br><br>

    <span style="color: #6f8dbd"><i>3d6 result in 2, 4 and 5, the result is a 5.</i></span>

    <br><br>

    <span style="color: #6f8dbd"><i>2d6 result in 2 and 6, the player rolls the one die again for a 3, the result is 9 (6+3)</i></span>

    <br><br>

    <span style="color: #6f8dbd"><i>4d6 result in 1, 3, 6 and 6, the player rolls two dice again for 1 and 3, the result is 9 (6+3)</i></span>

    <br><br>
    
    <span style="color: #6f8dbd">2d6 result in 2 and 6, the player rolls one die again for a 6. The player then rolls this die another time for a 2, the result is 14 (6+6+2)</span>
