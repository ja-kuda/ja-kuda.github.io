    <h1>Checks</h1>

    Every time a character tries to take an action or does something that has reasonable stakes, they state what they are doing and what they wish to accomplish with it.
    Based on that description by the players, the GM then can call for a check by asking a player to roll a certain skill.

    <br><br>

    Not every action necessarily has to call for a check, situations without tension or actions and activities that are inconsequential or have no real repercussions if they go awry can often be resolved by simply stating what happens.
    The GM can make this decision based on the players description and can decide if and how an action leads the players into the next situation.

    <h2>Intention</h2>

    It is one of the players main jobs to detail their characters actions in such a way, taht the GM can deduce a way for the story to move forward and lead the game into a new scene.
    The better the players describe their actions and wanted outcomes, the more easy it is for the GM to call for an appropriate check.

    <br><br>

    When being asked, what their character wants to do to resolve a situation, a player should always try and describe what they are doing, how they are doing it and what they hope to achieve with that action.
    Based on that description, the GM then calls for a check.

    <br><br>

    If a player thinks they should make a different check for their characters actions, they can ask the GM to reconsider or try to explain their ideas more detailed.
    In these case the GM can choose to allow for a different check to be made or stay with their initial choice, as they have the last word.

He wants to jump across a gap between two houses and unroll on the other side to keep his momentum and speed up. The GM calls for an agility check to escape the guards and keep running.</i></span>

    <br><br>

    <span style="color: #6f8dbd"><i>Luna the sorceress is right behind him and is unsure of her footing and her ability to safely make it to the other side. She wants to find for a safer way that also lets her escape the guards. In this case the GM might call for a vigilance check to be made, so she can quickly look for a more safe route across the rooftops.</i></span>

    <br><br>

    NOTE: These discussions should always be held short and of course respectfully, as to not disrupt the flow of the game. Sometimes it is better to just go with a ruling and later on discuss it in more detail and learn from it for the next time.

    <h2>Scope and Progress</h2>

    Usually a check resolves an action or situation and creates a new one to put the characters in.
    Most of the time this means, that a single check is enough to resolve an action as set out by the players roleplay.

    <br><br>

    <span style="color: #6f8dbd"><i>An adventuring party needs to escape a crumbling ruin or temple. On their way out, some minor enemies try to block their escape. To keep the scene running and to create a feeling of urgency, getting through one of these foes can be handled by a single check for each character, maybe killing or dodging them completely on a successful check.</i></span>

    <br><br>

    Sometimes though things take a little more time and can not easily be resolved with a single check.
    A long awaited duel between a character and their rival, the taming of a wild beast or crafting a complex invention are not that easily resolved with a single check.
    Instead of handling a skirmish check as a whole fight between two characters, you might find it more fitting to act out the individual feints and strikes in more detail, making checks for each of them, allowing the characters to make more detailed decisions.

    <br><br>

    <span style="color: #6f8dbd"><i>A character has to duel their former master in a one on one battle to the death. To increase dramatic tensions and make the fight suspenseful and important, the GM could ask the player to describe in more detail what their character does during the fight, maybe even breaking the fight down to making checks for single sword strokes until one of them finally falls.</i></span>

    <br><br>

    On the other hand, checks should only be called by the GM if there is a realistic chance of failure and possible interesting outcomes that can arise from conflict created by these checks.
    Simple tasks or those, that have no real consequences can be easily done through roleplaying.

    <br><br>

    <span style="color: #6f8dbd"><i>Tunis the ranger wants to set up a trap for small animals to catch something to eat for the night. They did this a thousand times and should really know how to do it effectively and quickly. They just do it without making a check and later on find a rabbit caught in the trap.</i></span>

    <br><br>

    The scope and gained progress of checks should be set by the GM based on the story and the situation at hand and usually a check should always be able to resolve a certain situation by creating a new situation that takes the first ones place.
    Changing up the scope should be used for special scenes that either have an emotional impact on the story or represent a situation better as a part of multiple checks chained together to achieve a single outcome.

    <h2>Difficulty</h2>

    The GM should determine a difficulty for each action of big enough scope described by the players that determines wether the following check will be successful, fail or otherwise create conflict.
    Based on the players descriptions of their actions, they can choose a number that best represents the actions difficulty, risks and potential outcomes.
    This number can range from 2 for an extremely simple action to potentially infinite for nearly impossible actions.

    <br>

    Most of the time however the difficulty should range from 3 to 6 for easy and medium checks and from 7 to 10 for harder checks.

    <br><br>

    As a rule of thumb, keep in mind, that check results that are in the direct vicinity of the checks difficulty can be handled slighlty differently than those that are far below the expected value.

    <h2>Rolling Checks</h2>

    When rolling a check the player rolls a number of dice based on their skills for the check and chooses the highest of the dice as their result.

    <br><br>

    <strong>Dice size</strong>
    <br>
    The basic dice for all checks are d8 or eight-sided dice.
    This basic size can be manipulated and changed through various effects like traits, boons and flaws, as well as talents, magical spells or items.
    Increasing a die means that instead of using a d8, the player would use a d10, increasing it again would result in a d12.
    Decrasing dice works exactly the same but in the opposite direction.
  	<br>
    Dice can usually only be manipulated to range from a d4 to a d12 but other effects might break this general rule.

    <br><br>

    <strong>Number of dice</strong>
    <br>
    Each check is rolled with at least 1 die.
    <br>
    The number of dice a player rolls in a given check vary based on a number of factors however, the most important one being the skill used for the check.
    All characters have a number of skills, each associated with a number or their proficiency in that skill.
    <br>
    Each skill point adds another d8 to the check.
    Other effects and abilities can also add more dice, but the usual number of rolled dice for any given check ranges from 1 to 6 and only rarely exceeds it.

    <br><br>

    <strong>Exploding dice</strong>
    <br>
    If one or more dice roll their maximum value, they explode and are rolled again and added to the previous roll.
    This can happen multiple times, should more than one die roll their maximum value they are both rolled again and the highest of those is added to the previous result.

    <br><br>

    The following examples should give you an idea of how checks are rolled:

    <br><br>

    <span style="color: #6f8dbd"><i>3d8 result in 2, 4 and 5, the result is a 5.</i></span>

    <br><br>

    <span style="color: #6f8dbd"><i>2d8 result in 2 and 8, the result is 8.</i></span>

    <br><br>

    <span style="color: #6f8dbd"><i>2d6 result in 1 and 6, the player rolls one die again for a 3, the result is 9 (6+3)</i></span>
