    <h1>The Basics</h1>
    <br>

    This chapter will give you insight into the main mechanics of Ambition and teach you how to play the game in its basic form.
    You will learn what checks are, how to roll them and what they will entail, creating conflict for the players, that their characters have to overcome in order to achieve their goals.

    This chapter might seem short, since the main mechanics of the game are purposefully designed to be as lightweight and easy to understand and follow as possible, as to allow the players to focus on creating a story, instead of having to look up rules and mechanics during the game.
    Ambition of course offers some selected options for deeper gameplay and character creation, but we will get to them in due time.

    This chapter is fundamentally important for all players and also the GM.
    Every participant in the game should try to read and understand these basics to allow for a smooth gaming experience.
